# Pipz_Project_V3: Primary Style & Governance Guide

## 1. The Three Pillars of Truth
- **Structural Truth:** Every change must align with `_PROJECT_BLUEPRINT.txt`.
- **Logic Truth:** Invariants must be verified against `GLOBAL_LOGIC_RULES.csv`.
- **Safety Truth:** Constraints in `PROJECT_LEARNED_CONSTRAINTS.txt` are non-negotiable.

## 2. Mandatory Initialization
- **Bootstrap v4:** MUST be executed at the start of every session.
- **Rule 16:** Adhere to "ANYSKIPPERS" token protocol.
- **Visibility Check:** Confirm all parent folders (`\Controller`, `\Lib`, `\Worker`) are visible in context.

## 3. Response Mandates
- **1:1 Literal Match:** NO summarization. NO truncation.
- **Header Supremacy:** Every code response must start with a `MAINTEMPLATE` header from `STANDARDIZED_HEADERS.txt`.
- **PLC Emissions:** Per Instruction Rule 3d, draft new constraints immediately upon discovery.

## 4. Code & Tooling Invariants
- **AutoHotkey:** Strict v2 syntax. No v1.1 carryover.
- **Python:** Indentation must be preserved mechanically (Ref: PLC-0005).
- **Registry:** Updates must be provided in raw, tab-separated "sheet" style within code blocks.
