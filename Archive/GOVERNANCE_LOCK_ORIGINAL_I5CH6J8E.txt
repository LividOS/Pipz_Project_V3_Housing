GOVERNANCE LAYER LOCK — DECLARATION OF STABLE STATE
; ------------------------------------------------------------------

(CANONICAL, NON-AUTHORITATIVE)

This document records a **governance lifecycle state transition** for Pipz_Project_V3.

It does NOT define rules.
It does NOT grant authority.
It does NOT override any governance mechanism.

Its sole purpose is to provide a **durable, verifiable record** that the governance layer
has entered a **stable, locked phase**.

; ------------------------------------------------------------------
1. GOVERNANCE LOCK STATUS
; ------------------------------------------------------------------

Status: **LOCKED (OPERATIONAL)**

As of this declaration:

; - The governance architecture for Pipz_Project_V3 is considered **stable**
; - Core governance rules are finalized, including implicit file resolution and constraint consultation rules
; - Initialization, verification, and enforcement semantics are fixed

The authoritative governance sources remain:

; - `Pipz_Project_V3\Governance\AI_PROJECT_INSTRUCTIONS.txt`
; - `Pipz_Project_V3\Governance\BOOTSTRAPv4.txt`
; - `Pipz_Project_V3\Governance\_PROJECT_BLUEPRINT.txt`
; - `Pipz_Project_V3\Governance\_PROJECT_ANCHOR_MASTER.txt`
; - `Pipz_Project_V3\Governance\INDEXIDLIST.txt`

This file does not participate in governance enforcement.

; ------------------------------------------------------------------
2. SCOPE OF THE LOCK
; ------------------------------------------------------------------

The following are considered **locked**:

; - Bootstrap v4 phase structure and semantics
; - Content-Fingerprint enforcement rules
; - GEMINI MEM TAG identity requirements
; - Stop-on-conflict behavior
; - Verification precedence rules
; - Phase 5 invocation boundaries

The following remain **permitted** without reopening governance:

; - Adding new files or modules to the project
; - Updating `_PROJECT_BLUEPRINT.txt` to reflect structural extensions
; - Updating `INDEXIDLIST.txt` to reflect new resolvable items
; - Updating mirrors and fingerprints as part of normal operation

No change may alter **governance behavior** without explicitly reopening the governance layer.

; ------------------------------------------------------------------
3. WHAT THIS FILE IS NOT
; ------------------------------------------------------------------

This document:

; - Is NOT consulted during Bootstrap execution
; - Is NOT required for Bootstrap success
; - Is NOT used to resolve conflicts
; - Is NOT used to validate fingerprints
; - Is NOT referenced during Phase 5 execution
; - Is NOT a substitute for any governance file

In all conflicts, this file has **zero authority**.

; ------------------------------------------------------------------
4. GOVERNANCE REOPENING RULE (STRICT)
; ------------------------------------------------------------------

Reopening the governance layer requires **explicit, intentional action**.

A governance reopening MUST:

1. Be explicitly declared by the user

2. Result in a versioned update to:

   ; - `AI_PROJECT_INSTRUCTIONS.txt`
   ; - AND / OR `BOOTSTRAPv4.txt`

3. Be accompanied by an updated declaration in this file

Absent those conditions, governance is considered locked.

; ------------------------------------------------------------------
5. INTENDED AUDIENCE
; ------------------------------------------------------------------

This file exists for:

; - Long-term project integrity
; - Future session clarity
; - Human verification
; - Audit traceability

It exists to prevent ambiguity — not to introduce it.

; ------------------------------------------------------------------
