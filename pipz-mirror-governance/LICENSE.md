GRANT OF PERMISSION
------------------------------------------------------------------

Permission is hereby granted to use, copy, and modify this software
(the “Software”) for personal, internal, or project-specific use,
provided that all conditions below are strictly adhered to.

This Software is designed to operate as part of a governed automation
and auditing system. Its correct behavior depends on compliance with
external governance rules, header mandates, and audit protocols.

------------------------------------------------------------------
CONDITIONS OF USE
------------------------------------------------------------------

1. GOVERNANCE INTEGRITY

   Any use, modification, or redistribution of this Software MUST
   preserve all governance-related behavior, including but not limited to:

   - Mandatory header enforcement
   - Content-Fingerprint generation and updating
   - Deterministic mirroring behavior
   - Fail-closed logic when governance conditions are not met
   - Audit logging where applicable

   Removing, bypassing, or weakening governance checks is expressly
   prohibited.

2. NO MISREPRESENTATION

   You may not claim that modified versions of this Software are
   “governed”, “audited”, or “compliant” unless they strictly preserve
   the original enforcement semantics.

3. INTERNAL-FIRST INTENT

   This Software is intended primarily for internal workflows and
   controlled environments. Public redistribution is permitted only
   if this license and all governance behaviors are preserved in full.

4. NO AUTOMATED DELEGATION WITHOUT OVERSIGHT

   This Software may not be used as an autonomous agent with write
   authority unless it is operating under an explicit supervisory or
   orchestrated system that provides auditability and rollback.

INTENT STATEMENT (NON-NORMATIVE)
------------------------------------------------------------------

This license exists to protect the integrity of governed automation
systems. The goal is not restriction for its own sake, but to prevent
silent drift, unverifiable behavior, and un-audited automation.

If you are unsure whether a use case complies with this license,
assume it does not.
