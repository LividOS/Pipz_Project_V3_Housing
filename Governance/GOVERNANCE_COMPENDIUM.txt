GOVERNANCE COMPENDIUM — AUTHORITATIVE DECLARATION

This document, GOVERNANCE_COMPENDIUM.txt, is the sole authoritative governance artifact for Pipz_Project_V3 in single-artifact mode.

All prior standalone governance files are represented as deterministic sections within this document.

Any rule, protocol, or hard-stop condition that previously depended on the existence or readability of a separate governance file now depends on the existence and full readability of:
  - GOVERNANCE_COMPENDIUM.txt, and
  - the relevant governance section(s) identified by their stable Section IDs.

If the compendium or any required section cannot be located or fully read, governed operations MUST STOP.

Archived originals are stored separately under /Archive and are non-operative.

SECTION ID CONTRACT (STABLE IDENTITIES)

The following Section IDs are case-sensitive, immutable, and must never be aliased:

- GOV.S1.AI_INSTRUCTIONS  (origin: AI_PROJECT_INSTRUCTIONS.txt)
- GOV.S2.BOOTSTRAP_V4  (origin: BOOTSTRAPv4.txt)
- GOV.S3.BLUEPRINT  (origin: _PROJECT_BLUEPRINT.txt)
- GOV.S4.ANCHOR_MASTER  (origin: _PROJECT_ANCHOR_MASTER.txt)
- GOV.S5.PHASE5_AUDIT  (origin: PHASE5_AUDIT_MASTER.txt)
- GOV.S6.GOVERNANCE_LOCK  (origin: GOVERNANCE_LOCK.txt)
- GOV.S7.INDEX_ID_LIST  (origin: INDEXIDLIST.txt)
- GOV.S8.LEARNED_CONSTRAINTS  (origin: PROJECT_LEARNED_CONSTRAINTS.txt)
- GOV.S9.STANDARD_HEADERS  (origin: STANDARDIZED_HEADERS.txt)

POLICY A — ARCHIVED ORIGINAL HEADERS

Within each section below:
  - "ARCHIVED ORIGINAL (VERBATIM)" is included for cross-checking.
  - It is NON-AUTHORITATIVE for file-identity/path assertions (e.g., GEMINI MEM TAG full paths, MAINTEMPLATE filename headers).
  - Operative governance semantics for single-artifact mode are defined by the "OPERATIVE TEXT (COMPENDIUM MODE)" block.

REGISTRY AUTHORITY NOTICE (EXTERNAL)

The following artifacts are authoritative registries and are intentionally NOT embedded as compendium sections:
  - GLOBAL_REGISTRY_MASTER.csv (Policy-B governed surface)
  - INTERNAL_FUNCTION_INDEX.csv (non-governed symbol index)
  - GLOBAL_REGISTRY_MASTER.gsheet (backup vault only, if referenced)

Any governance rule that requires registry verification continues to require these artifacts externally. If a required registry cannot be located or read, the original hard-stop semantics apply unchanged.

INTERPRETATION & CONFLICT RULES (MANDATORY)

IR-1. ARCHIVED ORIGINAL (VERBATIM) content exists solely for:
     - literal fidelity verification
     - cross-checking against historical standalone files
     - audit traceability

IR-2. ARCHIVED ORIGINAL content MUST NOT be used for:
     - governance reasoning
     - enforcement decisions
     - STOP / hard-stop evaluation
     - proposal justification
     - semantic interpretation

IR-3. OPERATIVE TEXT (COMPENDIUM MODE) is the ONLY valid source for
     active governance semantics in single-artifact mode.

IR-4. If any semantic, procedural, or enforcement conflict is detected between:
     - ARCHIVED ORIGINAL content, and
     - OPERATIVE TEXT

     The conflict MUST be explicitly reported.
     The AI MUST NOT resolve the conflict implicitly or by precedence assumption.

IR-5. A governance section is considered UNREADABLE if:
     - it cannot be fully located, OR
     - it is truncated, partially visible, or cut off

     Partial readability SHALL be treated as unreadable for all enforcement purposes
     and MUST trigger the same STOP conditions as total absence.

; ------------------------------------------------------------------
BOOTSTRAP v4 — CONVERSATION INITIALIZATION PROTOCOL (MANDATORY)
; ------------------------------------------------------------------

Bootstrap v4 is a mandatory conversation initialization protocol for Pipz_Project_V3.

Its purpose is to guarantee that the AI can reliably re-establish full project authority at the start of any new chat without relying on memory, inference, cached state, or Google Drive search heuristics.

Bootstrap v4 MUST be executed before any analysis, debugging, suggestions, refactors, or proposed changes related to Pipz_Project_V3.

; ------------------------------------------------------------------
BOOTSTRAP ARTIFACT REFERENCE RULE (CANONICAL — SINGLE-ARTIFACT MODE)
; ------------------------------------------------------------------

The canonical, authoritative definition of the Bootstrap v4 protocol is:

; - GOVERNANCE_COMPENDIUM.txt :: SECTION GOV.S2.BOOTSTRAP_V4

Rules:

B1. At the start of every new chat related to Pipz_Project_V3, after completing
    PHASE 0 of this section, the AI MUST locate, open, and fully read:

    ; - GOVERNANCE_COMPENDIUM.txt :: SECTION GOV.S2.BOOTSTRAP_V4

B2. Bootstrap v4 MUST be executed strictly according to the operative text
    contained in GOVERNANCE_COMPENDIUM.txt :: SECTION GOV.S2.BOOTSTRAP_V4.

B3. Any archived, historical, summarized, or duplicated Bootstrap content
    elsewhere in the compendium is NON-AUTHORITATIVE.

B4. The declaration:
    "BOOTSTRAP v4 COMPLETE — Pipz_Project_V3 authority established."
    is VALID only if the above section has been read in full during the
    current session.

B5. If GOVERNANCE_COMPENDIUM.txt or the required section cannot be located,
    fully read, or verified (including Content-Fingerprint), the AI MUST STOP.

; ------------------------------------------------------------------
BOOTSTRAP v4 ENFORCEMENT GATE (ABSOLUTE)
; ------------------------------------------------------------------

E1. Any response related to Pipz_Project_V3 that includes analysis, reasoning, suggestions, debugging, refactors, audits, or proposed changes MUST occur only after successful Bootstrap v4 completion in the same session.

E2. Successful Bootstrap v4 completion is defined exclusively as:

    ; - Full execution of Phases 0–4 as defined in GOVERNANCE_COMPENDIUM.txt :: SECTION GOV.S2.BOOTSTRAP_V4, AND
    ; - Emission of the exact declaration:

      "BOOTSTRAP v4 COMPLETE — Pipz_Project_V3 authority established."

E3. If the declaration has not been emitted in the current session:

    ; - The AI MUST NOT proceed
    ; - The AI MUST instruct the user to initiate or allow Bootstrap v4 execution
    ; - The AI MUST NOT infer prior completion, even if files appear unchanged

E4. Memory, prior conversation history, prior confirmations, or previous chats MUST NOT be used as evidence of Bootstrap completion.

E5. This rule applies to:

    ; - New chats
    ; - Resumed chats
    ; - Long-running chats after context loss
    ; - Any situation where authority cannot be freshly proven

; ------------------------------------------------------------------
BOOTSTRAP v4 INVOCATION TOKEN REQUIREMENT (ABSOLUTE)
; ------------------------------------------------------------------

For any new chat session related to Pipz_Project_V3, the user's FIRST message MUST include
a machine-checkable invocation token.

Two invocation formats are permitted.

FORMAT 1 — FULL CANONICAL INVOCATION:

BOOTSTRAP_V4_INIT
This project is defined in my Google Drive under Pipz_Project_V3.
Locate GOVERNANCE_COMPENDIUM.txt :: SECTION GOV.S1.AI_INSTRUCTIONS
and initiate Bootstrap v4.

FORMAT 2 — TOKEN-ONLY INVOCATION:

BOOTSTRAP_V4_INIT

Rules:

T1. The first non-empty line of the user's first message MUST be exactly:

    BOOTSTRAP_V4_INIT

T2. If additional lines are present after the token, they MUST be exactly:

    This project is defined in my Google Drive under Pipz_Project_V3.
    Locate GOVERNANCE_COMPENDIUM.txt :: SECTION GOV.S1.AI_INSTRUCTIONS and initiate Bootstrap v4.

T3. FORMAT 2 (token-only) is explicitly permitted and does NOT require
    the presence of the canonical text lines.

T4. If the token is missing, malformed, reordered, or paraphrased:

    ; - The AI MUST STOP.
    ; - The AI MUST request the user to resend a valid invocation.
    ; - The AI MUST NOT assume a Drive-backed project exists.
    ; - The AI MUST NOT initiate Bootstrap v4.

T5. Google Drive connector availability alone does NOT constitute authorization.

T6. This token requirement exists to guarantee:

    ; - Clean cold-start behavior.
    ; - No reliance on memory.
    ; - Deterministic bootstrap execution across AI platforms.

; ------------------------------------------------------------------
PHASE 0 — GOVERNANCE GATE
; ------------------------------------------------------------------

The AI MUST:
0.1 Locate, open, and fully read:

    ; - GOVERNANCE_COMPENDIUM.txt :: SECTION GOV.S1.AI_INSTRUCTIONS (VIRTUAL FILE — REQUIRED)
	
0.2 Verify:

    ; - Presence of GEMINI MEM TAG
    ; - Presence of Content-Fingerprint
    ; - Fingerprint is readable and well-formed
	
0.3 Obey all rules defined in this file, including:

    ; - Mandatory re-verification
    ; - Fingerprint precedence
    ; - Stop-on-conflict behavior
    ; - Hidden Permanence Confirmation Rule (Rule 16)

STOP CONDITIONS:

; - File cannot be opened
; - File is truncated
; - Fingerprint is missing or malformed
; - Any rule cannot be satisfied

; ------------------------------------------------------------------
PHASE 0.5 — FINGERPRINT ENFORCEMENT INVARIANT (ABSOLUTE)
; ------------------------------------------------------------------

At no point during Bootstrap v4 may any governed file be reasoned about,
interpreted, or used for decision-making prior to successful verification
of its declared Content-Fingerprint.

Temporary access, partial reads, or structural inspection without completed
fingerprint verification are prohibited and MUST trigger STOP.

Hierarchy Clarification:

PHASE 0.5 establishes a GLOBAL gating invariant.
Rules governing fingerprint mechanics (cache-busting,
declaration ordering, or response formatting) operate
ONLY after this gate is satisfied.

No reasoning, inspection, or classification is permitted
prior to successful PHASE 0.5 completion.

; ------------------------------------------------------------------
PHASE 1 — ROOT RESOLUTION
; ------------------------------------------------------------------

Bootstrap v4 MUST NOT rely on Google Drive search alone.

Root resolution precedence is STRICT:

1) GOVERNANCE_COMPENDIUM.txt :: SECTION GOV.S7.INDEX_ID_LIST (if present)
2) GEMINI MEM TAG declared paths
3) GOVERNANCE_COMPENDIUM.txt :: SECTION GOV.S3.BLUEPRINT defined structure
4) Google Drive search (LAST RESORT ONLY)

Drive IDs provide deterministic location only and do not establish content truth.
If the project root cannot be resolved deterministically, the AI MUST STOP.

; ------------------------------------------------------------------
PHASE 2 — CANONICAL GOVERNANCE SET VERIFICATION (SINGLE-ARTIFACT MODE)
; ------------------------------------------------------------------

Governance sections are treated as VIRTUAL FILES and must be fully readable.
The AI MUST verify the following authoritative governance sources:

; - GOVERNANCE_COMPENDIUM.txt :: SECTION GOV.S1.AI_INSTRUCTIONS
; - GOVERNANCE_COMPENDIUM.txt :: SECTION GOV.S3.BLUEPRINT
; - GOVERNANCE_COMPENDIUM.txt :: SECTION GOV.S4.ANCHOR_MASTER
; - GOVERNANCE_COMPENDIUM.txt :: SECTION GOV.S7.INDEX_ID_LIST
; - GLOBAL_REGISTRY_MASTER (AUTHORITY HIERARCHY):
    1. PRIMARY: GLOBAL_REGISTRY_MASTER.csv (Authoritative governed registry, Policy-B)
    2. FALLBACK: GLOBAL_REGISTRY_MASTER.gsheet (Backup Vault ONLY — may be unreadable to tooling)

Each file must:

; - Be readable in full
; - Declare Content-Fingerprint where applicable
; - Match declared identity
; - [REGISTRY SPECIFIC]:
;     - Verify GLOBAL_REGISTRY_MASTER.csv is readable in full.
;     - Verify it represents Policy-B governed surface area only (entrypoints/timers/IPC/lifecycle/settings/defaults).
;     - Verify INTERNAL_FUNCTION_INDEX.csv exists if referenced by the task, but it is non-governed and not a hard stop.

STOP CONDITIONS:

; - Any file is missing
; - Any file is unreadable or truncated
; - GLOBAL_REGISTRY_MASTER.csv is missing or desynchronized AND .gsheet fallback is inaccessible
; - Any required registry section is inaccessible

; ------------------------------------------------------------------
PHASE 3 — STRUCTURE RECONSTRUCTION
; ------------------------------------------------------------------

Using only authoritative declarations, the AI reconstructs the expected project structure, including:

; - Root directory
; - Governance directory
; - Registry directory
; - Controller, Worker, and Lib subdirectories (as defined by GOVERNANCE_COMPENDIUM.txt :: SECTION GOV.S3.BLUEPRINT)
; - Required .txt mirrors
; - Required runtime counterparts

This phase establishes what MUST exist, not what Drive happens to expose.
Inference, assumption, or memory-based reconstruction is prohibited.

; ------------------------------------------------------------------
PHASE 4 — VERIFICATION DECLARATION
; ------------------------------------------------------------------

Only after Phases 0–3 succeed may the AI:

; - Declare Bootstrap v4 completion
; - Proceed with analysis, debugging, or code work

All subsequent responses MUST continue to obey:

; - Fingerprint declaration rules
; - Stop-on-conflict rules
; - No inference / no assumption rules

; ------------------------------------------------------------------
PHASE 5 — FULL VISIBILITY & ACCESSIBILITY AUDIT (OPTIONAL)
; ------------------------------------------------------------------

Phase 5 is an optional extension to Bootstrap v4.
Phase 5 MUST NOT be executed unless the user explicitly requests it by name.

Phase 5 MUST NEVER be:

; - Implied
; - Assumed
; - Auto-invoked
; - Triggered as part of Bootstrap v4
; - Executed due to partial failure, uncertainty, or missing Drive visibility

Phase 5 does not establish governance correctness.

; ------------------------------------------------------------------
PHASE 5 — PURPOSE
; ------------------------------------------------------------------

When invoked, Phase 5 performs a full recursive audit of the project's Google Drive presence to determine:

; - Which directories and files exist
; - Which are readable
; - Which are missing
; - Which are orphaned
; - Which are mis-located
; - Which are ungoverned
; - Which are inaccessible due to permissions or indexing failures

; ------------------------------------------------------------------
PHASE 5 — EXECUTION RULES
; ------------------------------------------------------------------

Phase 5 execution MUST follow the operative text in
GOVERNANCE_COMPENDIUM.txt :: SECTION GOV.S5.PHASE5_AUDIT (VIRTUAL FILE).

5.1 Root-Anchored Traversal
; - Enumeration MUST begin from the resolved project root folder ID
; - Child discovery MUST use parent-child traversal
; - Google Drive search MUST NOT be used for discovery

5.2 Recursive Enumeration
For every folder:

; - Enumerate all files and subfolders
; - Record Drive ID, name, parent ID, and type
; - Attempt to open readable files

5.3 Path Reconstruction
For every discovered item:

; - Rebuild full path by walking parents to root
; - Compare against:

  ; - GEMINI MEM TAG paths
  ; - Blueprint-defined expected locations

5.4 Reconciliation
Compare:

1) Expected set (Blueprint + Anchor)
2) Discovered set (Drive traversal)
3) Indexed set (INDEXIDLIST)

Classify each item as:

; - VERIFIED
; - UNREADABLE
; - MISSING
; - ORPHANED
; - UNGOVERNED

; ------------------------------------------------------------------
PHASE 5 — OUTPUT
; ------------------------------------------------------------------

Phase 5 produces a read-only audit report.

Phase 5 MUST NOT:

; - Modify files
; - Create mirrors
; - Update registries
; - Repair structure

Failures in Phase 5 DO NOT invalidate Bootstrap v4 but MUST be explicitly reported.

; ------------------------------------------------------------------
POLICY-B GOVERNANCE MODEL (MANDATORY)
; ------------------------------------------------------------------

The project uses a dual-layer registry system to balance strict governance with
practical development velocity.

----------------------------------------
A) GLOBAL_REGISTRY_MASTER.csv (Policy-B)
----------------------------------------

GLOBAL_REGISTRY_MASTER.csv is the authoritative governed registry.

It is POLICY-B scoped, meaning it MUST contain ONLY governance-critical surface area:

- Entrypoints (startup paths, GUI entrypoints, externally-triggered handlers)
- Timers (SetTimer callbacks)
- OnMessage handlers / IPC receivers
- IPC sender contracts and message encodings
- Settings IO and Defaults interface
- Lifecycle and process controls
- Logic invariants directly tied to the above surface area

The governed registry is:
- CSV-first
- Tooling-readable
- Deterministic
- A hard-stop authority for governed surface changes

The AI MUST consult this registry before:
- Modifying any governed surface item
- Introducing new timers, IPC handlers, entrypoints, or lifecycle controls

----------------------------------------
B) INTERNAL_FUNCTION_INDEX.csv (NON-GOVERNED)
----------------------------------------

INTERNAL_FUNCTION_INDEX.csv is a NON-GOVERNED, informational index.

It exists to:
- Provide a complete symbol inventory (functions, methods, classes)
- Aid navigation, search, and refactors
- Avoid forcing governance churn for internal helpers

Rules:
- It may be regenerated at any time.
- It may drift.
- It MUST NOT cause hard stops.
- It MUST NOT be treated as authoritative governance.

The AI MAY use this file for discovery and orientation, but MUST NOT:
- Require registry updates based solely on internal helper changes
- Treat missing entries here as violations

----------------------------------------
C) AI OBLIGATIONS (CRITICAL)
----------------------------------------

The AI MUST:
- Enforce Policy-B boundaries strictly.
- Update or flag registry changes ONLY when governed surface area changes.
- Avoid expanding governance scope into internal implementation details.
- Use signposts and the governed registry together to understand ownership and invariants.

The AI MUST NOT:
- Reintroduce section-based registry assumptions.
- Require all functions or variables to appear in a governed registry.
- Treat INTERNAL_FUNCTION_INDEX.csv as a hard-stop authority.

----------------------------------------
D) CONFLICT RESOLUTION
----------------------------------------

If a conflict exists between:
- Code
- GLOBAL_REGISTRY_MASTER.csv
- Signpost declarations

The AI must:
1) Flag the conflict explicitly.
2) Propose reconciliation options.
3) Wait for confirmation before proceeding.

----------------------------------------
E) INTERACTION WITH GOVERNANCE COMPENDIUM (MANDATORY)
----------------------------------------

In single-artifact mode, all conflict handling MUST comply with
GOV.S0.COMPENDIUM_META — INTERPRETATION & CONFLICT RULES.

No registry, signpost, or code conflict may be implicitly resolved by
precedence alone.

Specifically:

- Precedence rules define WHICH rule would apply
- They do NOT authorize implicit resolution

If a conflict exists between any governed rules, procedures, or constraints:

1. The conflict MUST be explicitly identified and reported
2. The AI MUST STOP unless explicitly instructed how to proceed
3. Precedence MUST NOT be applied silently or implicitly

Failure to report a detected conflict before resolution constitutes
a governance violation.

----------------------------------------
F) POLICY-B CONFLICT RESOLUTION (GOVERNED SURFACE AREA)
----------------------------------------
SEQUENCING REQUIREMENT:

This section MUST NOT be consulted unless:
1. A conflict has been explicitly identified
2. STOP conditions in Section E have been triggered
3. Explicit user instruction authorizing resolution has been received

Violation of this sequence constitutes a governance breach.

This section applies ONLY after all conflict-handling requirements in:

- E) INTERACTION WITH GOVERNANCE COMPENDIUM (MANDATORY)

have been satisfied.

Scope:
This rule applies exclusively to Policy-B governed surface area, defined as:

- Entrypoints
- Timers (SetTimer callbacks)
- OnMessage / IPC handlers
- IPC sender contracts and encodings
- Settings IO and defaults interface
- Lifecycle and process controls

Rules:

PB-1. If a conflict exists involving Policy-B governed surface area, the conflict
      MUST first be explicitly identified, reported, and gated by STOP
      as required by Section E.

PB-2. Once explicit conflict reporting has occurred and the user has
      explicitly authorized resolution, GLOBAL_REGISTRY_MASTER.csv
      is the authoritative source of truth.

PB-3. No Policy-B conflict may be resolved by:
      - inference
      - heuristic reasoning
      - code inspection alone
      - precedence shortcuts
      - assumed registry intent

PB-4. If GLOBAL_REGISTRY_MASTER.csv is missing, unreadable, or ambiguous
      with respect to the conflicted surface area, the AI MUST STOP.

PB-5. Resolution authority for Policy-B conflicts is NEVER implicit.
      Explicit user instruction is mandatory.

END POLICY-B CONFLICT RESOLUTION

; ------------------------------------------------------------------
0. Permanence Reinforcement Rule
; ------------------------------------------------------------------

0a. At the start of every session, the AI must confirm it has read this file.

0b. Connector Availability Requirement Rule

0ba. If Google Drive access is unavailable, disconnected, expired, or fails at any point during a session, the AI must:
0baa. Explicitly state that Google Drive access is unavailable.
0bab. Stop immediately without analysis, suggestions, or assumptions.
0bac. Wait for the user to restore access.

----------------------------------------
0.5. TERMINOLOGY NORMALIZATION (MANDATORY)
----------------------------------------

In single-artifact mode:

- References to a "file" SHALL be interpreted as:
  - GOVERNANCE_COMPENDIUM.txt :: <SECTION ID>
    unless explicitly stated otherwise.

- Governance sections are treated as VIRTUAL FILES and are subject to:
  - full-read requirements
  - truncation detection
  - STOP semantics identical to physical files

- Physical file references are valid ONLY for:
  - runtime artifacts
  - registries explicitly declared as external
  - tooling-constrained formats (e.g., .json)

This rule applies globally unless explicitly overridden.

; ------------------------------------------------------------------
1. Blueprint Architecture Reference Rule
; ------------------------------------------------------------------

1a. Whenever a request involves:
1aa. File interactions
1ab. Module responsibilities
1ac. Includes or dependencies
1ad. Ownership of logic
1ae. Controller/worker boundaries

1b. The AI must:
1ba. Locate and read the current GOVERNANCE_COMPENDIUM.txt :: SECTION GOV.S3.BLUEPRINT from Google Drive.
1bb. The authoritative project structure is defined by:
  - GOVERNANCE_COMPENDIUM.txt :: SECTION GOV.S3.BLUEPRINT

This section is the sole structural authority.
No other section, registry, runtime artifact, or inference
may define, expand, or reduce project structure.

1bc. Reject any reasoning or suggestion that contradicts the blueprint.

1c. If the blueprint cannot be verified, the AI must stop.

; ------------------------------------------------------------------
2. Mandatory Re-Verification Rule
; ------------------------------------------------------------------

2a. For every response related to Pipz_Project_V3:

2aa. The AI must identify which project files are relevant to the user's request.
2ab. The AI must locate, open, and fully read the current .txt mirror of each relevant file from Google Drive within the same response cycle.
2ac. The AI must base its response only on the contents verified in that cycle, not on memory from prior messages.
2ad. If any relevant mirror file cannot be found, opened, or verified as current, the AI must stop and report the issue.

2b. Cached knowledge, prior conversation context, or previous reads may not be used as substitutes for verification.

; ------------------------------------------------------------------
2c. Content-Fingerprint Cache-Busting Rule
; ------------------------------------------------------------------

2ca. Every relevant .txt mirror must contain a Content-Fingerprint line in its MAINTEMPLATE header.

2cb. Content-Fingerprint format is defined as:
YYYY-MM-DDTHH-MM-SSZ-XXXXXXXX

Where:
; - The timestamp is in UTC.
; - The suffix is exactly 8 characters.
; - Valid suffix characters are uppercase A–Z and digits 0–9.

2cc. For each relevant .txt mirror read in a response cycle, the AI must locate and extract the Content-Fingerprint value.

2cd. The AI must treat any previously-read copy of that file as stale if its Content-Fingerprint differs from the value extracted in the current cycle.

2ce. If the user supplies a Content-Fingerprint (full or suffix-only) for a file, the AI must verify that the current .txt mirror's Content-Fingerprint matches before reasoning or proposing changes.

2cf. If a relevant .txt mirror lacks a Content-Fingerprint line, the AI must stop and report the missing fingerprint.

; ------------------------------------------------------------------
2d. Response Fingerprint Declaration Rule
; ------------------------------------------------------------------

2da. For any response that includes analysis, suggestions, refactors, debugging, or proposed changes related to Pipz_Project_V3, the AI must declare the Content-Fingerprint value(s) it used.

2db. This declaration must appear at the very top of the response, before any analysis or content, in the following format:

Fingerprint Used: <Content-Fingerprint>

2dc. If multiple files are involved, the AI must list each file and its corresponding Content-Fingerprint.

2dd. If the AI cannot confidently declare the Content-Fingerprint used, it must stop and report the verification failure instead of responding.

; ------------------------------------------------------------------
2e. Fingerprint Challenge Mode (FCM) Rule
; ------------------------------------------------------------------

2ea. If the very first line of the user's message begins with the exact prefix "FCM-", the AI must treat the request as a Fingerprint Challenge Mode (FCM) request.

2eb. FCM line format (STRICT):

FCM-<FINGERPRINT>-<FILENAME>

2ebc. <FINGERPRINT> may be provided in one of two allowed formats:

2ebca. Full fingerprint format:
YYYY-MM-DDTHH-MM-SSZ-XXXXXXXX

2ebcb. Suffix-only fingerprint format:
XXXXXXXX

Where:
; - XXXXXXXX is the final 8 characters of the Content-Fingerprint.
; - Valid characters are uppercase A–Z and digits 0–9.

2ebd. The AI must determine which fingerprint format was provided based on structure and length, not by assumption.

2ebe. If a full fingerprint is provided, the AI must compare the entire Content-Fingerprint value for an exact match.

2ebf. If a suffix-only fingerprint is provided, the AI must compare only the final 8 characters of the Content-Fingerprint, but must still extract and later declare the full Content-Fingerprint value used.

2ec. Multiple FCM lines may be provided, one per file, and must appear as consecutive lines at the very top of the user's message before any other content.

2ed. For each FCM line, the AI must:
2eda. Locate, open, and fully read the corresponding .txt mirror from Google Drive.
2edb. Extract the full Content-Fingerprint value.
2edc. Perform the comparison required by Rule 2ebe or 2ebf.

2ee. If any comparison fails, the AI must stop and respond with:
2eea. An explicit statement that the fingerprint did not match.
2eeb. The expected fingerprint or suffix provided by the user.
2eec. The full Content-Fingerprint value found in the mirror.

2eef. While any FCM mismatch exists, the AI must not provide analysis, suggestions, refactors, debugging, or proposed changes.

2ef. If all FCM checks pass, the AI may proceed, but must still comply with Rule 2d by declaring the full Content-Fingerprint value(s) used at the top of its response.

; ------------------------------------------------------------------
2f. Drive Folder / File ID Acceleration Rule (NON-SUBSTITUTIVE)
; ------------------------------------------------------------------

2fa. If the user provides explicit Google Drive folder IDs or file IDs, the AI is permitted to use them to enumerate contents directly.

2fb. Provided IDs may be used to:
2fba. Resolve the project root directory.
2fbb. Enumerate full directory trees, including non-text assets.
2fbc. Locate files that are not discoverable via content search.

2fc. Drive IDs are an acceleration mechanism only and MUST NOT replace:
2fca. Targeted search requirements.
2fcb. GEMINI MEM TAG path verification.
2fcc. Content-Fingerprint verification.
2fcd. Registry and blueprint verification.

2fd. If Drive ID enumeration results conflict with search results, declared paths, or fingerprints:
2fda. The AI must stop.
2fdb. Report the discrepancy.
2fdc. Wait for explicit user instruction.

2fe. Absence of provided Drive IDs MUST NOT be treated as an error or failure condition.

; ------------------------------------------------------------------
2g. Drive ID vs Verification Precedence Rule (AMBIGUITY RESOLUTION)
; ------------------------------------------------------------------

2ga. Google Drive folder and file IDs (including VERIFIED status) provide deterministic location only and do not establish content truth, freshness, or correctness.
2gb. The precedence order is STRICT:
2gba. AI_PROJECT_INSTRUCTIONS governance rules.
2gbb. Content-Fingerprint verification (cache-busting rules).
2gbc. GEMINI MEM TAG declared path identity.
2gbd. Blueprint-defined structure and responsibility.
2gbe. Drive IDs, folder listings, and search results.

2gc. If Drive IDs conflict with declared paths, fingerprints, or blueprint structure:
2gca. The AI must stop immediately.
2gcb. Report expected vs observed values.
2gcc. Wait for explicit user instruction.

2gd. If tooling limitations (including truncation, partial reads, or access restrictions) prevent a verifiable full read of any required governance file, relevant mirror file, or required registry tab:
2gda. The AI must stop and explicitly report the limitation.
2gdb. The AI must not infer, assume, summarize, or fabricate missing content under any circumstances, even if Drive IDs are VERIFIED.

2ge. If folder listing is unavailable or incomplete:
2gea. The AI may fall back to search-only reconstruction using declared paths.
2geb. The fallback is valid only if all required verification rules (fingerprints, path identity, and required file reads) can still be satisfied.
2gec. If verification cannot be satisfied under fallback, the AI must stop.

; ------------------------------------------------------------------
2h. Project Learned Constraints Mandatory Consultation Rule (ABSOLUTE)
; ------------------------------------------------------------------

2ha. Before the AI may perform any analysis, reasoning, suggestion, refactor,
     debugging step, architectural proposal, or solution design related to
     Pipz_Project_V3, the AI MUST:

2haa. Locate, open, and fully read:
      ; - GOVERNANCE_COMPENDIUM.txt :: SECTION GOV.S8.LEARNED_CONSTRAINTS

2hab. Actively evaluate whether any existing constraint is relevant to the
      current task, file, subsystem, or approach under consideration.

2hb. The GOVERNANCE_COMPENDIUM.txt :: SECTION GOV.S8.LEARNED_CONSTRAINTS file is authoritative for negative
     knowledge.

2hc. Any approach, method, or pattern recorded as invalidated or constrained
     MUST NOT be repeated, suggested, or reintroduced unless the user explicitly
     authorizes re-evaluation.

2hd. If a relevant learned constraint exists:
2hda. The AI MUST acknowledge it internally before reasoning.
2hdb. The AI MUST NOT propose the constrained approach.
2hdc. The AI MUST adapt its reasoning accordingly or stop.

2he. During any session, if the AI discovers that:
2hea. A method it attempted failed,
2heb. A proposal it made was invalid,
2hec. A tooling or architectural assumption was proven incorrect,
2hed. Or an approach conflicts with project reality,

2hf. The AI MUST immediately draft a proposed entry for:
      ; - GOVERNANCE_COMPENDIUM.txt :: SECTION GOV.S8.LEARNED_CONSTRAINTS

2hg. Drafted constraint entries MUST:
2hga. Follow the Project Learned Constraints ID Policy.
2hgb. Clearly describe the invalidated approach.
2hgc. Be presented to the user explicitly for confirmation or rejection.

2hh. Failure to consult GOVERNANCE_COMPENDIUM.txt :: SECTION GOV.S8.LEARNED_CONSTRAINTS before reasoning, or
     failure to draft a newly discovered constraint, constitutes a violation
     of this instruction set and requires the AI to stop under Rule 3b.

; ------------------------------------------------------------------
2i. Implicit File Reference Resolution Rule (ABSOLUTE)
; ------------------------------------------------------------------

2ia. If the user references a project file by name or role (explicitly or
     implicitly), and that file is part of Pipz_Project_V3 governance,
     structure, or tooling, the AI MUST attempt deterministic resolution
     before claiming inability to read or locate the file.

2ib. Deterministic resolution MUST follow this order:
2iba. Consult GOVERNANCE_COMPENDIUM.txt :: SECTION GOV.S7.INDEX_ID_LIST for a matching file entry,
      including alias and role mappings defined therein.
2ibb. Use the associated Drive ID to locate and open the file.
2ibc. Verify the file identity using path declarations and fingerprints.

2ic. The AI MUST NOT state that it cannot locate, read, or verify a file
     if a valid Drive ID exists for that file in GOVERNANCE_COMPENDIUM.txt :: SECTION GOV.S7.INDEX_ID_LIST.

2id. Only if:
     ; - No matching entry exists in GOVERNANCE_COMPENDIUM.txt :: SECTION GOV.S7.INDEX_ID_LIST, AND
     ; - Path-based resolution fails, AND
     ; - Search fallback is exhausted per Rule 2g,
     may the AI report inability to locate the file.

2ie. Failure to consult GOVERNANCE_COMPENDIUM.txt :: SECTION GOV.S7.INDEX_ID_LIST when resolving an implicitly
     referenced file constitutes a violation of this instruction set
     and requires the AI to stop under Rule 3b.

; ------------------------------------------------------------------
2j. Response Status Header Rule (ABSOLUTE)
; ------------------------------------------------------------------

2ja. Any AI response that references, analyzes, reasons about, or proposes
     changes to any Pipz_Project_V3 file, structure, registry, blueprint,
     indexing, or governance artifact MUST include exactly one of the
     following status headers:

STATUS — LIVE
STATUS — HISTORICAL

2jb. STATUS — LIVE may be used ONLY if, in the current response cycle, the AI has:
2jba. Completed all required Bootstrap gating for the session when applicable.
2jbb. Complied with Rule 2 (Mandatory Re-Verification) for all relevant files.
2jbc. Complied with Rule 2h (PROJECT_LEARNED_CONSTRAINTS consultation).
2jbd. Complied with Rule 2i (deterministic resolution using INDEXIDLIST, including aliases).

2jc. STATUS — HISTORICAL MUST be used if any condition required by Rule 2jb
     cannot be satisfied in the current response cycle.

2jd. HISTORICAL RESPONSE LIMITATION (ABSOLUTE):
2jda. A STATUS — HISTORICAL response MUST contain explanation and remediation only.
2jdb. A STATUS — HISTORICAL response MUST NOT contain substantive analysis,
      reasoning, design proposals, refactors, debugging steps, or code changes.
2jdc. A STATUS — HISTORICAL response MUST comply with Rule 3b:
      ; - Cite the blocking rule(s)
      ; - Explain why compliance is not possible
      ; - Propose 1–3 resolution paths
      ; - Wait for explicit user instruction

2je. ORDERING RULE (STRICT):
2jea. If Rule 16 initial confirmation applies, the first non-empty line MUST be:
      ANYSKIPPERS
2jeb. If Rule 16 initial confirmation applies, the STATUS header MUST appear as
      the next non-empty line immediately after ANYSKIPPERS.
2jec. Otherwise, the STATUS header MUST be the first non-empty line of the response.

2jf. LIVE + FINGERPRINT ORDERING (STRICT):
2jfa. If STATUS — LIVE is used and the response contains analysis/suggestions/
      refactors/debugging/proposed changes, the response MUST also comply with Rule 2d
      by declaring Fingerprint Used immediately after the STATUS header.

2jg. Failure to include the required STATUS header, or misuse of STATUS — LIVE,
     constitutes a violation of this instruction set and requires STOP under Rule 3b.

; ------------------------------------------------------------------
2k. Pre-Transmission Sanity Audit (MANDATORY EXIT-GATE)
; ------------------------------------------------------------------
2ka. Prior to completing any response, the AI MUST perform a silent internal 
     audit of the proposed content against all required governance sections of GOVERNANCE_COMPENDIUM.txt.
2kb. VERIFICATION CRITERIA:
     - Is there a Version Header from GOVERNANCE_COMPENDIUM.txt :: SECTION GOV.S9.STANDARD_HEADERS?
     - Is the content a 1:1 literal match (no summarization)?
     - Does the logic violate any PLC (e.g., PLC-0005 or PLC-0006)?
     - Are all registry updates formatted in raw tab-separated style?
2kc. If any violation is detected, the AI must discard the drafted response 
     and regenerate a compliant version.
2kd. Failure to perform this audit or outputting non-compliant content 
     constitutes a "Hard-Stop" breach under Rule 3b.

; ------------------------------------------------------------------
3. Scope of Authority Rule
; ------------------------------------------------------------------

3a. These rules govern all AI involvement in Pipz_Project_V3, including:

3aa. Analysis
3ab. Suggestions
3ac. Refactors
3ad. New features
3ae. Audits
3af. Debugging
3ag. Documentation updates

3b. If any rule in this document cannot be followed, the AI must stop and report why.

3ba. The AI must explicitly state which rule(s) cannot be followed.
3bb. The AI must explain why the rule(s) cannot be satisfied in the current situation.
3bc. The AI must propose at least one viable resolution path.
3bd. When possible, the AI must propose two to three alternative resolution paths.
3be. The AI must wait for explicit user instruction before proceeding.
3bf. This requirement applies to all STOP conditions defined elsewhere in this document.
3bg. This includes, but is not limited to, failure to comply with Rule 2h
     (Project Learned Constraints Mandatory Consultation Rule).
3bh. This includes, but is not limited to, failure to comply with Rule 2j
     (Response Status Header Rule).

3c. Project Learned Constraints ID Policy (ABSOLUTE)

3ca. All entries in GOVERNANCE_COMPENDIUM.txt :: SECTION GOV.S8.LEARNED_CONSTRAINTS must be identified
     by a stable, monotonically increasing ID using the format:

     PLC-XXXX

Where: 
;- XXXX is a zero-padded decimal number.

3cb. IDs are assigned strictly in order of discovery and must never be:

3cba. Reused
3cbb. Renumbered
3cbc. Reordered
3cbd. Repurposed to encode semantic meaning

3cc. Gaps in numbering are permitted and must not be filled.

3cd. The ID itself is an opaque identifier; all meaning must be expressed
     in the entry title and body, not in the ID.

3ce. Any reference to a learned constraint in governance, audits, reasoning,
     or regression prevention must reference the constraint by its PLC ID.

3cf. Deleting or modifying an existing PLC entry does not permit reassignment
     of its ID.

; ------------------------------------------------------------------
3d. Proactive Constraint Capture Mandate (THE "EMISSION" RULE)
; ------------------------------------------------------------------

3da. Upon identifying a "Learned Constraint" (defined as any discovery that 
     invalidates a previous approach, reveals a platform/tooling limitation, 
     or identifies a non-obvious failure mode), the AI MUST immediately 
     stop and draft a new entry for GOVERNANCE_COMPENDIUM.txt :: SECTION GOV.S8.LEARNED_CONSTRAINTS.

3db. The AI is FORBIDDEN from attempting to "fix" the issue in code or 
     structural files until the PLC entry has been formally proposed and 
     accepted into the project context.

3dc. The draft MUST follow the MAINTEMPLATE format and adhere to the 
     ID Policy defined in Rule 3c.

3dd. Proceeding before documenting a known regression in the 
     PLC constitutes a Governance Breach under Rule 3b.

; ------------------------------------------------------------------
4. Version Header Enforcement Rule (ABSOLUTE)
; ------------------------------------------------------------------

4a. The AI must NEVER modify, suggest modifying, or generate modified code unless the file contains a valid version header and that header is updated as part of the change.

4b. Required header format (STRICT):

; ------------------------------------------------------------------
; MAINTEMPLATE - FILENAME (AHK v2)
; Version: x.x.x (SEMANTIC VERSIONING)
; Last change: BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE MOST RECENT CHANGES.
; ------------------------------------------------------------------

4c. Enforcement rules:

4ca. Semantic versioning is mandatory:
4caa. MAJOR → breaking changes
4cab. MINOR → new behavior / features
4cac. PATCH → fixes, refactors, non-breaking changes

4cb. Exactly one "Last change" line.
4cc. If the header is missing, outdated, malformed, or not updated, the AI must refuse the change.

; ------------------------------------------------------------------
4d. Cross-Language Header Comment Prefix Compatibility Rule (ABSOLUTE)
; ------------------------------------------------------------------

4da. The required MAINTEMPLATE header fields and semantics (Version, Last change, Content-Fingerprint) apply to ALL governed-readable files, not only .ahk.

4db. The comment prefix used for the MAINTEMPLATE header and related governance lines MUST match the file’s language:

4dba. ';'  → .ahk, .ini, and governed .txt documents
4dbb. '//' → .js and .ts
4dbc. '#'  → .py, .yml, and .yaml

4dc. JSON files (.json) MUST NOT include commented headers (JSON does not support comments). For governed JSON, a sidecar governance file MUST be used:

4dca. <file>.json (pure JSON)
4dcb. <file>.json.governance.txt (governed header + identity + fingerprint)

4dd. If the correct comment prefix cannot be used (e.g., due to parser or tooling constraints), the AI MUST STOP under Rule 3b and propose a compliant alternative.

; ------------------------------------------------------------------
5. Drive Mirror Rule (PRIMARY READ SOURCE)
; ------------------------------------------------------------------

5a. The AI must treat .txt mirrors in Google Drive as the authoritative readable source.

5aa. Drive-backed artifacts define PHYSICAL REALITY only.
5ab. Authoritative governance semantics are derived exclusively from:
     - GOVERNANCE_COMPENDIUM.txt sections (virtual files)
5ac. Drive visibility does not confer governance authority.
5ad. Unreadable or truncated governance sections MUST trigger STOP,
     regardless of Drive availability or file existence.
5ae. Partial visibility, truncation, or section-level unreadability of
     GOVERNANCE_COMPENDIUM.txt or any required Section ID
     SHALL be treated as UNREADABLE per GOV.S0.COMPENDIUM_META IR-5
     and MUST trigger an immediate STOP.

5b. Rules:
5ba. .txt files are used for reading, analysis, verification, and reasoning.
5bb. .ahk / .ini files are treated as runtime artifacts only.
5bc. If a .txt mirror and a runtime file disagree, the .txt mirror wins.

5c. The AI must never assume parity and must verify.

; ------------------------------------------------------------------
6. Path Identity Requirement Rule
; ------------------------------------------------------------------

6a. Every file the AI reads or modifies must be identified by its declared path, not by inference.

6b. Mandatory check:
6ba. Each .txt mirror must contain a path declaration:

; GEMINI MEM TAG
; MY FULL PATH IS "Pipz_Project_V3\<relative\path>"

6c. Rules:
6ca. The AI must confirm this tag before reasoning about file location.
6cb. Path reconstruction must use this tag, never assumptions.
6cc. If the tag is missing or ambiguous, the AI must stop.

6cd. The GEMINI MEM TAG and path declaration lines MUST be commented using the file’s correct comment prefix as defined in Rule 4d (e.g., '//' for .js/.ts, '#' for .py/.yaml). The semantic text must remain identical.

6ce. The AI MUST NOT reject an otherwise valid GEMINI MEM TAG solely because the comment prefix differs from ';' when the file type requires a different prefix.

; ------------------------------------------------------------------
7. Registry Supremacy Rule
; ------------------------------------------------------------------

7a. The Registry Authority is defined by the following hierarchy:
7aa. PRIMARY: GLOBAL_REGISTRY_MASTER.csv (Authoritative governed registry, Policy-B)
7ab. SECONDARY: GLOBAL_REGISTRY_MASTER.gsheet (Backup Vault ONLY — may be unreadable to tooling)
7ac. NON-GOVERNED INDEX: INTERNAL_FUNCTION_INDEX.csv (Informational, regenerable; not a hard-stop)

7b. GLOBAL_REGISTRY_MASTER.csv is the single source of truth for Policy-B governance surface area:
7ba. Entrypoints (startup / handlers)
7bb. Timers (SetTimer callbacks)
7bc. IPC send/receive contracts (OnMessage/WM_* where applicable)
7bd. Settings IO + Defaults interface
7be. Lifecycle / process controls
7bf. Logic invariants tied to the governed surface area

7c. AI obligations (Policy-B aligned):
7ca. The AI MUST consult GLOBAL_REGISTRY_MASTER.csv before writing code that affects governed surface area.
7cb. The AI MUST NOT introduce, remove, or rename any governed surface entrypoint/timer/IPC/lifecycle/settings interface without a corresponding registry update plan.
7cc. Internal helpers are permitted to exist outside the governed registry and must NOT force registry churn.
7cd. INTERNAL_FUNCTION_INDEX.csv may be used to locate internal helpers, but it is informational and may drift.
7ce. If code conflicts with GLOBAL_REGISTRY_MASTER.csv on governed surface ownership or invariants:
7cea. The AI must flag the conflict.
7ceb. Propose reconciliation.
7cec. Wait for confirmation before proceeding.

; ------------------------------------------------------------------
8. Blueprint Synchronization Rule
; ------------------------------------------------------------------

8a. Any AI-suggested or AI-generated change that affects:
8aa. Structure
8ab. Ownership
8ac. Architecture
8ad. Responsibility

8b. Must be reflected in:
8ba. Code
8bb. .txt mirror
8bc. GOVERNANCE_COMPENDIUM.txt :: SECTION GOV.S3.BLUEPRINT (and GOVERNANCE_COMPENDIUM.txt :: SECTION GOV.S4.ANCHOR_MASTER when applicable)

8c. If synchronization is incomplete, the change is invalid.

; ------------------------------------------------------------------
9. Verification-Before-Action Rule
; ------------------------------------------------------------------

9a. Before the AI may:
9aa. Refactor
9ab. Optimize
9ac. Extend functionality
9ad. Move code
9ae. Rename symbols

9b. It must first:
9ba. Locate the file via Drive.
9bb. Open and read its full contents.
9bc. Confirm registry alignment.
9bd. Confirm blueprint alignment.

9c. Skipping any step is prohibited.

; ------------------------------------------------------------------
10. No Assumptions / No Hallucination Rule
; ------------------------------------------------------------------

10a. The AI must never:
10aa. Assume a file exists
10ab. Assume a function exists
10ac. Assume a variable is global
10ad. Infer structure from memory

10b. If a file or symbol cannot be found via Drive or Registry:
10ba. It does not exist.
10bb. The AI must stop and report the gap.

; ------------------------------------------------------------------
11. Change Granularity Rule
; ------------------------------------------------------------------

11a. One logical change per action.

11b. No bundled edits.

11c. No opportunistic refactors.

11d. Each change must satisfy all of the following:
11da. Be explainable in one sentence.
11db. Map cleanly to one version bump.

; ------------------------------------------------------------------
12. Stop-On-Conflict Rule
; ------------------------------------------------------------------

12a. If the AI detects:
12aa. Registry mismatch
12ab. Mirror mismatch
12ac. Blueprint mismatch
12ad. Missing file
12ae. Ambiguous ownership

12b. It must:
12ba. Stop immediately.
12bb. Describe the conflict.
12bc. Propose resolution paths.
12bd. Wait for explicit instruction.

12c. No auto-resolution is allowed.

; ------------------------------------------------------------------
13. Drive Is Ground Truth Rule
; ------------------------------------------------------------------

13a. For the AI:
13aa. The file hierarchy defined in Rule 7 (GSheet > CSV) and the 
     structural mirrors in GOVERNANCE_COMPENDIUM.txt :: SECTION GOV.S3.BLUEPRINT define reality.
13ab. Local state is irrelevant.
13ac. Past conversation memory is advisory only.

13b. If Drive and memory disagree, the Drive-based Authority Hierarchy wins.

; ------------------------------------------------------------------
14. Instruction Self-Enforcement Rule
; ------------------------------------------------------------------

14a. The AI must:
14aa. Continuously check its own output against these rules.
14ab. Refuse requests that would violate them.
14ac. Explicitly state which rule blocks an action if refusing.

14b. Silence or compliance in violation of these rules is considered failure.

; ------------------------------------------------------------------
15. Literal Fidelity Rule
; ------------------------------------------------------------------

15a. Whenever the AI outputs, reproduces, quotes, references, or proposes changes to the contents of any project file, the AI must preserve the exact text verbatim.

15b. The AI must not truncate, shorten, paraphrase, summarize, reformat, normalize, or omit any portion of the original content.

15c. Unchanged content must be reproduced exactly as-is, character-for-character.

15d. Changed content must be clearly and explicitly distinguished from unchanged content.

15e. Partial excerpts, summaries, paraphrases, diffs, or selective quotations are prohibited unless explicitly requested by the user.

15f. If the AI cannot reproduce the content verbatim due to length, uncertainty, tooling limits, or verification failure, the AI must stop and report the limitation instead of approximating.

15g. Any response that alters meaning, removes context, or silently modifies content constitutes a violation of this rule.

; ------------------------------------------------------------------
16. Hidden Permanence Confirmation Rule
; ------------------------------------------------------------------

16a. "Initial confirmation" means the first non-empty line of the AI's first response in a session that is related to Pipz_Project_V3.
A response is "related to Pipz_Project_V3" if it contains any analysis, reasoning, verification, suggestions, refactors, debugging steps, or proposed changes involving Pipz_Project_V3 files, structure, registry, blueprint, or Drive contents.

16b. When the AI provides the initial confirmation as defined in Rule 16a (and required by Rule 0), the confirmation message must:
16ba. Appear before any other analysis or content.
16bb. Contain the exact text "ANYSKIPPERS".

16c. The text "ANYSKIPPERS" is a single-use confirmation token and must not be treated as persistent knowledge.

16d. After the initial confirmation message:
16da. The AI must not reuse, reference, rely on, or reproduce the text "ANYSKIPPERS".
16db. Any subsequent confirmation of having read this file must be based on a fresh verification of the file contents and must independently satisfy Rule 0.
16dc. Reuse of "ANYSKIPPERS" in later confirmations constitutes a violation of this instruction set.
16dd. The text "ANYSKIPPERS" must not be obtained from, inferred from, or reused from prior conversation history, cached context, or any source other than a fresh read of this file performed in the current session as required by Rule 0.

16e. Rule 16 applies exclusively to the initial confirmation defined in Rule 16a and must not be interpreted as a substitute for fingerprint-based verification required by Rules 2c, 2d, and 2e in subsequent responses.

; ------------------------------------------------------------------

; ------------------------------------------------------------------
BOOTSTRAP v4 — CONVERSATION INITIALIZATION PROTOCOL
; ------------------------------------------------------------------

(FINALIZED SPECIFICATION)

Bootstrap v4 is a **mandatory conversation initialization protocol** for Pipz_Project_V3.

Its purpose is to guarantee that the AI can **reliably re-establish full project authority** at the start of any new chat **without relying on memory, inference, or Drive search heuristics**.

Bootstrap v4 is **not optional** and must be executed before *any* analysis, debugging, or code work.

; ------------------------------------------------------------------
PHASE 0 — GOVERNANCE GATE (HARD STOP)
; ------------------------------------------------------------------

The AI **MUST**:

1. Locate, open, and fully read:

   ; - `GOVERNANCE_COMPENDIUM.txt :: SECTION GOV.S1.AI_INSTRUCTIONS`

2. Verify:

   ; - Presence of GEMINI MEM TAG
   ; - Presence of Content-Fingerprint
   ; - Fingerprint is well-formed and readable

3. Obey **all rules** defined within, including but not limited to:

   ; - Mandatory re-verification rules
   ; - Fingerprint precedence rules
   ; - Stop-on-conflict rules
   ; - ANYSKIPPERS single-use confirmation requirement

STOP CONDITIONS (ABSOLUTE):

; - File cannot be opened
; - File is truncated
; - Fingerprint is missing or malformed
; - Any rule cannot be satisfied

No further phases may execute if Phase 0 fails.

; ------------------------------------------------------------------
PHASE 1 — ROOT RESOLUTION (NO SEARCH HEURISTICS)
; ------------------------------------------------------------------

Bootstrap v4 **does not rely on Google Drive search alone**.

Root resolution uses the following **strict precedence order**:

1. `GOVERNANCE_COMPENDIUM.txt :: SECTION GOV.S7.INDEX_ID_LIST` (if present)

   ; - Canonical Drive folder ID for `\Pipz_Project_V3`
   ; - Declared as acceleration only, never truth

2. GEMINI MEM TAG declared paths

3. `GOVERNANCE_COMPENDIUM.txt :: SECTION GOV.S3.BLUEPRINT` defined structure

4. Google Drive search (LAST RESORT ONLY)

RULE:

Drive IDs accelerate access but do not establish authority.

If root cannot be resolved deterministically → **STOP**.

; ------------------------------------------------------------------
PHASE 2 — CANONICAL FILE SET VERIFICATION
; ------------------------------------------------------------------

The AI **MUST** locate, open, and fully read the following mandatory files:
; - GOVERNANCE_COMPENDIUM.txt :: SECTION GOV.S1.AI_INSTRUCTIONS
; - GOVERNANCE_COMPENDIUM.txt :: SECTION GOV.S3.BLUEPRINT
; - GOVERNANCE_COMPENDIUM.txt :: SECTION GOV.S4.ANCHOR_MASTER
; - GOVERNANCE_COMPENDIUM.txt :: SECTION GOV.S7.INDEX_ID_LIST
; - GOVERNANCE_COMPENDIUM.txt :: SECTION GOV.S8.LEARNED_CONSTRAINTS

The AI **MUST** ALSO locate and read the MASTER REGISTRY (Policy-B):
; - PRIMARY: GLOBAL_REGISTRY_MASTER.csv (Authoritative governed registry, Policy-B)
; - SECONDARY: GLOBAL_REGISTRY_MASTER.gsheet (Backup Vault ONLY — may be inaccessible to tooling)

Each file must:
; - Be readable in full
; - Declare Content-Fingerprint (where applicable)
; - Match its declared identity
; - Adhere to the PLC-0006 "Flat-File Sovereignty" constraint

STOP CONDITIONS:
; - Any of the mandatory governance sections of GOVERNANCE_COMPENDIUM.txt are missing.
; - GLOBAL_REGISTRY_MASTER.csv is missing or unreadable.
; - The registry cannot be verified as Policy-B scoped.

; ------------------------------------------------------------------
PHASE 3 — STRUCTURE RECONSTRUCTION (EXPECTED STATE)
; ------------------------------------------------------------------

Using **only authoritative declarations**, the AI reconstructs the **expected project structure**, including:

; - Root directory
; - Governance directory
; - Registry directory
; - Controller / Worker / Lib / Modules directories
; - Required `.txt` mirrors
; - Required runtime counterparts

This phase establishes **what must exist**, not what Drive happens to expose.
No inference is permitted.

; ------------------------------------------------------------------
PHASE 4 — VERIFICATION DECLARATION
; ------------------------------------------------------------------

Only after Phases 0–3 succeed may the AI:

; - Declare successful Bootstrap v4 completion
; - Proceed with analysis, debugging, or code work

All subsequent responses must continue to obey:

; - Mandatory fingerprint declarations
; - Stop-on-conflict behavior
; - No assumption / no inference rules

; ------------------------------------------------------------------
BOOTSTRAP v4 — COMPLETION DECLARATION (CANONICAL)
; ------------------------------------------------------------------

If and only if Phases 0 through 4 complete successfully, the AI MUST emit
the following declaration verbatim in its response:

"BOOTSTRAP v4 COMPLETE — Pipz_Project_V3 authority established."

Rules:

1. The declaration MUST:

   ; - Appear as a standalone line
   ; - Appear before any analysis, reasoning, or suggestions
   ; - Appear only after successful completion of Phases 0–4

2. The declaration MUST NOT:

   ; - Be paraphrased
   ; - Be abbreviated
   ; - Be combined with other text
   ; - Be emitted conditionally or speculatively

3. If any phase fails:

   ; - The declaration MUST NOT be emitted
   ; - The AI MUST stop and report the failure point

4. This declaration:

   ; - Does NOT bypass fingerprint verification
   ; - Does NOT bypass registry checks
   ; - Does NOT authorize Phase 5 implicitly

This declaration signals initialization success only.
All subsequent rules remain in force.

; ------------------------------------------------------------------

================================================================================
BOOTSTRAP v4 — SINGLE-ARTIFACT MODE ADDENDUM
APPLIES WHEN: GOVERNANCE_COMPENDIUM.txt IS PRESENT AND AUTHORITATIVE
================================================================================

This addendum defines how Bootstrap v4 operates when Pipz_Project_V3 governance
is consolidated into GOVERNANCE_COMPENDIUM.txt under single-artifact mode.

This addendum is ADDITIVE and does not replace or modify the canonical Bootstrap
v4 phase definitions. All existing Bootstrap v4 rules remain in force unless
explicitly overridden here.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
A. AUTHORITY REBINDING (MANDATORY)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

When GOVERNANCE_COMPENDIUM.txt is present and declared authoritative:

- GOVERNANCE_COMPENDIUM.txt becomes the sole bootstrap governance container.
- All prior standalone governance files are treated as ARCHIVED ORIGINALS only.
- Bootstrap v4 MUST resolve governance artifacts via Section IDs, not filenames.

Canonical Bootstrap authority is now:

- GOVERNANCE_COMPENDIUM.txt :: SECTION GOV.S2.BOOTSTRAP_V4

If this section cannot be located or fully read, Bootstrap v4 MUST STOP.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
B. PHASE 0 — COMPENDIUM GATE (ADDITIVE)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Phase 0 MUST additionally verify:

[ ] GOVERNANCE_COMPENDIUM.txt is readable in full
[ ] Compendium MAINTEMPLATE header is present
[ ] Content-Fingerprint is present and well-formed
[ ] Required governance sections are not truncated:
    - GOV.S1.AI_INSTRUCTIONS
    - GOV.S2.BOOTSTRAP_V4
    - GOV.S3.BLUEPRINT
    - GOV.S7.INDEX_ID_LIST

If ANY required section is unreadable or truncated → STOP.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
C. FILE RESOLUTION OVERRIDE (MANDATORY)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

All Bootstrap references to governance files are rebound as follows:

- AI_PROJECT_INSTRUCTIONS.txt
  → GOVERNANCE_COMPENDIUM.txt :: SECTION GOV.S1.AI_INSTRUCTIONS

- BOOTSTRAPv4.txt
  → GOVERNANCE_COMPENDIUM.txt :: SECTION GOV.S2.BOOTSTRAP_V4

- _PROJECT_BLUEPRINT.txt
  → GOVERNANCE_COMPENDIUM.txt :: SECTION GOV.S3.BLUEPRINT

- _PROJECT_ANCHOR_MASTER.txt
  → GOVERNANCE_COMPENDIUM.txt :: SECTION GOV.S4.ANCHOR_MASTER

- PHASE5_AUDIT_MASTER.txt
  → GOVERNANCE_COMPENDIUM.txt :: SECTION GOV.S5.PHASE5_AUDIT

- INDEXIDLIST.txt
  → GOVERNANCE_COMPENDIUM.txt :: SECTION GOV.S7.INDEX_ID_LIST

Legacy file paths MUST NOT be consulted when compendium mode is active.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
D. STOP CONDITION REINFORCEMENT
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Bootstrap v4 MUST STOP if:

- GOVERNANCE_COMPENDIUM.txt is unreadable
- Any required Section ID cannot be located
- Any required section is partially visible or truncated
- Section ID conflicts with Compendium Meta (GOV.S0)
- Archived Original content is mistakenly used for enforcement

Partial visibility SHALL be treated as total absence.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
E. DECLARATION INTEGRITY
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The declaration:

"BOOTSTRAP v4 COMPLETE — Pipz_Project_V3 authority established."

is VALID ONLY IF:

- GOVERNANCE_COMPENDIUM.txt was read in full
- GOVERNANCE_COMPENDIUM.txt :: SECTION GOV.S2.BOOTSTRAP_V4 was read in full
- All Phase 0–4 requirements were satisfied under compendium rules

AUTHORITATIVE ROLE DECLARATION (PHASE 5)

This section constitutes the sole authoritative Expected Set definition used during Phase 5 reconciliation.
All Expected items for Phase 5 MUST be derived exclusively from this section.
No other file, index, registry, or Drive enumeration source may define, expand, or reduce the Expected Set.

GOVERNANCE_COMPENDIUM.txt :: SECTION GOV.S7.INDEX_ID_LIST provides acceleration only.
GOVERNANCE_COMPENDIUM.txt :: SECTION GOV.S4.ANCHOR_MASTER provides intent, identity rules, architectural rationale and constraints only.
Discovered Drive contents provide Observed Set data only.

GOVERNANCE STRUCTURE NOTE (SINGLE-ARTIFACT MODE)

All authoritative governance content is consolidated into:

  - GOVERNANCE_COMPENDIUM.txt

No standalone governance files are expected to exist outside the compendium.

Historical governance sources have been archived under:
  - \Archive\ (non-authoritative, non-operative)

Index coverage does not imply expected existence.

The Archive directory MUST NOT be used for governance reasoning,
verification, or enforcement, Including for historical comparison unless explicitly instructed.

### 2. REGISTRY ACCESS & VERIFICATION PROTOCOL (CRITICAL)
; ------------------------------------------------------------------

To maintain a 1:1 literal match of the project state, the following protocol MUST be followed:

1. **REGISTRY LOCATION:** All Global State, Function, and Logic Rule data is stored externally in `GLOBAL_REGISTRY_MASTER.gsheet` (with `GLOBAL_REGISTRY_MASTER.csv` as the authoritative fallback mirror).

2. **BOOTSTRAP-ALIGNED INDEXING PROTOCOL:**
   ; - Project root resolution MUST follow Bootstrap v4 precedence rules.
   ; - `GOVERNANCE_COMPENDIUM.txt :: SECTION GOV.S7.INDEX_ID_LIST` MUST be used first when present to deterministically resolve the project root.
   ; - GEMINI MEM TAG path declarations are authoritative for identity and reconstruction.
   ; - Google Drive search is a LAST RESORT and must never override declared paths or fingerprints.

   ; - Once the root is resolved, enumerate and verify visibility of:
     ; - `\Controller`
     ; - `\Worker`
     ; - `\Lib`
     ; - `\Registry`
     ; - `\Governance`
     ; - `\Archive`
     ; - `\PPAVP`

   ; - Confirm visibility of all required governance sections of GOVERNANCE_COMPENDIUM.txt:
     ; - `GOVERNANCE_COMPENDIUM.txt :: SECTION GOV.S1.AI_INSTRUCTIONS`
     ; - `GOVERNANCE_COMPENDIUM.txt :: SECTION GOV.S3.BLUEPRINT`
     ; - `GOVERNANCE_COMPENDIUM.txt :: SECTION GOV.S4.ANCHOR_MASTER`
     ; - `GOVERNANCE_COMPENDIUM.txt :: SECTION GOV.S5.PHASE5_AUDIT`
     ; - `GOVERNANCE_COMPENDIUM.txt :: SECTION GOV.S2.BOOTSTRAP_V4`
     ; - `GOVERNANCE_COMPENDIUM.txt :: SECTION GOV.S6.GOVERNANCE_LOCK`
     ; - `GOVERNANCE_COMPENDIUM.txt :: SECTION GOV.S8.LEARNED_CONSTRAINTS`
     ; - `GLOBAL_REGISTRY_MASTER.gsheet`
     ; - `GLOBAL_REGISTRY_MASTER.csv`
     ; - `GOVERNANCE_COMPENDIUM.txt :: SECTION GOV.S7.INDEX_ID_LIST`
     ; - `GOVERNANCE_COMPENDIUM.txt :: SECTION GOV.S9.STANDARD_HEADERS`

   Visibility confirmation is existence and path correctness only.
   Runtime-only and non-readable assets (e.g. .png, .ahk, .ini, .key) are not subject to read or fingerprint verification.

3. **REGISTRY VERIFICATION PROTOCOL (POLICY-B SURFACE AREA):**
   ; - The AI MUST prioritize the PRIMARY readable registry source.
   ; - PRIMARY: `GLOBAL_REGISTRY_MASTER.csv` (Authoritative governed registry, Policy-B)
   ; - SECONDARY: `GLOBAL_REGISTRY_MASTER.gsheet` (Backup Vault ONLY — may be inaccessible to tooling)

   ; - Protocol:
     ; - Access `GLOBAL_REGISTRY_MASTER.csv` and verify it is readable in full.
     ; - Verify the registry is Policy-B scoped:
       ; - Contains only governance-critical surface area:
         ; - entrypoints (startup / GUI entrypoints where applicable)
         ; - timers (SetTimer callbacks)
         ; - OnMessage handlers / IPC receivers
         ; - IPC senders / contracts
         ; - settings IO + defaults interface
         ; - lifecycle / process controls
       ; - Internal helpers are NOT required to appear in this governed registry.

     ; - Full symbol discovery is handled by:
       ; - `INTERNAL_FUNCTION_INDEX.csv` (Non-governed, regenerable inventory)

     ; - If `GLOBAL_REGISTRY_MASTER.csv` is inaccessible or cannot be fully read, the AI MUST STOP.

4. **CONTENT-FINGERPRINT ENFORCEMENT:**
   ; - The Content-Fingerprint declared in this file (`GOVERNANCE_COMPENDIUM.txt :: SECTION GOV.S3.BLUEPRINT`) MUST be extracted and verified against the current Drive mirror before use.
   ; - Any mismatch between the declared fingerprint and the Drive mirror constitutes a hard stop.

5. **TOOLING LIMITATION HARD-STOP:**
   ; - If tooling limitations (including truncation, partial reads, or access restrictions) prevent a verifiable full read of this file, any required governance file, or any required registry section, the AI must stop and explicitly report the limitation.
   ; - The AI must not infer, assume, summarize, or fabricate missing content under any circumstances.

6. **CUMULATIVE INTEGRITY:** Never remove registry entries.
   Updates must maintain a 1:1 literal match with the source code and verified mirrors.

; ------------------------------------------------------------------
### 3. GLOBAL LOGIC ANCHORS
; ------------------------------------------------------------------

; - **DRY ARCHITECTURE:** No variable or function definitions should be hardcoded in text documents.
Refer to `GLOBAL_REGISTRY_MASTER.csv` for Policy-B governed surface area ownership and invariants.
For full symbol inventory, consult `INTERNAL_FUNCTION_INDEX.csv` (informational; non-governed).

; - **IPC STANDARD:** All communication between Controller and Worker uses WM_COPYDATA or custom message `0x5555`.

; - **STATE PERSISTENCE:** The Worker must remain a slave to `Settings.ini`; enforcement is handled by the Watchdog in `WorkerState.ahk`.

; - **GROUND TRUTH RULES (MANDATORY):** Logic invariants and non-negotiable behavior rules are defined in `GLOBAL_REGISTRY_MASTER.csv`
(Policy-B governed surface area). These rules must be consulted before audit, debugging, refactor, or feature change.

; ------------------------------------------------------------------

; ------------------------------------------------------------------
; SECTION A — PROJECT ANCHOR (CANONICAL AUTHORITY)
; ------------------------------------------------------------------

; ------------------------------------------------------------------
PROJECT ANCHOR: Pipz_Project_V3 (AutoHotkey v2)
; ------------------------------------------------------------------

**UNIFIED SYSTEM ANCHOR (CANONICAL):**
This file defines the *mission intent*, *behavioral constraints*, and *system-level anchoring rules* for Pipz_Project_V3.

>
Structural authority is defined in `GOVERNANCE_COMPENDIUM.txt :: SECTION GOV.S3.BLUEPRINT`.
Governance and enforcement authority is defined in `GOVERNANCE_COMPENDIUM.txt :: SECTION GOV.S1.AI_INSTRUCTIONS`.
>

This file MUST NOT override Bootstrap v4.

; ------------------------------------------------------------------
1. MISSION STATEMENT & IDENTITY (MUST BE MAINTAINED)
; ------------------------------------------------------------------

Pipz_Project_V3 is a dual-process automation system composed of:

; - **Controller (GUI / Orchestration)**
; - **Worker (Execution / Overlay / Runtime Engine)**

The system is implemented in **AutoHotkey v2** and is governed by strict separation of:
; - Authority
; - Visibility
; - Verification
; - Runtime execution

**CRITICAL IDENTITY RULE**
Every governed file **MUST** declare its identity using:

; GEMINI MEM TAG
; MY FULL PATH IS "Pipz_Project_V3\<relative\path>"

Absence, ambiguity, or mismatch of this tag constitutes a **hard stop**.

; ------------------------------------------------------------------
2. BOOTSTRAP & GOVERNANCE DEFERENCE (AUTHORITATIVE)
; ------------------------------------------------------------------

This file **DOES NOT** define initialization behavior.
All initialization, indexing, verification, and authority establishment is governed by:

; - `GOVERNANCE_COMPENDIUM.txt :: SECTION GOV.S1.AI_INSTRUCTIONS`
; - `GOVERNANCE_COMPENDIUM.txt :: SECTION GOV.S2.BOOTSTRAP_V4`

**RULES**
; - Bootstrap v4 is mandatory.
; - Phase ordering is strict.
; - This Anchor MUST NOT introduce alternate search paths, shortcuts, or fallback logic.
; - Any conflict between this file and Bootstrap v4 MUST be resolved in favor of Bootstrap v4.

**SYSTEM HIERARCHY & AUTHORITY**
The hierarchy of authority for Pipz_Project_V3 is:

1. GOVERNANCE_COMPENDIUM.txt :: SECTION GOV.S1.AI_INSTRUCTIONS (Rules 0–16)
2. GOVERNANCE_COMPENDIUM.txt :: SECTION GOV.S2.BOOTSTRAP_V4 (Initialization)
3. GOVERNANCE_COMPENDIUM.txt :: SECTION GOV.S3.BLUEPRINT (Structural Truth)
4. GLOBAL_REGISTRY_MASTER.csv (Authoritative governed registry, Policy-B)
5. INTERNAL_FUNCTION_INDEX.csv (Informational, regenerable; non-governed)
6. GLOBAL_REGISTRY_MASTER.gsheet (Backup Vault ONLY; may be unreadable to tooling)
7. GOVERNANCE_COMPENDIUM.txt :: SECTION GOV.S4.ANCHOR_MASTER (Intent & Rationale)

**NEW CHAT INVOCATION (REFERENCE ONLY)**
For a fresh session cold-start, the required user invocation (including the machine-checkable token `BOOTSTRAP_V4_INIT`) is defined in:

; - `GOVERNANCE_COMPENDIUM.txt :: SECTION GOV.S1.AI_INSTRUCTIONS`

This Anchor does not redefine or override invocation enforcement.

; ------------------------------------------------------------------
3. VISIBILITY VS GOVERNANCE DISTINCTION (CLARIFIED)
; ------------------------------------------------------------------

The project contains **three classes of artifacts**:

### A. Governed & Readable
; - `.txt` mirrors
; - Governance documents
; - Registry spreadsheets

These require:
; - Full read access
; - Content-Fingerprint verification
; - Path identity validation

### B. Runtime-Only / Non-Readable (N/A Governance)
Examples:
; - `.ahk`
; - `.ini`
; - `.png`
; - `.key`

These:
; - MUST exist at declared paths
; - MAY be enumerated via Drive
; - MUST NOT be read or reasoned about directly
; - Are classified as **N/A** in `GOVERNANCE_COMPENDIUM.txt :: SECTION GOV.S7.INDEX_ID_LIST`

### C. Externalized Authority
; - `GLOBAL_REGISTRY_MASTER.gsheet`

This is a **non-negotiable source of truth** and must be fully readable.

; ------------------------------------------------------------------
4. STRUCTURAL & EXPECTED-SET AUTHORITY (REFERENCE ONLY)
; ------------------------------------------------------------------

The expected project structure **and the authoritative Expected Set used for Phase 5** are defined **exclusively** in:

; - `GOVERNANCE_COMPENDIUM.txt :: SECTION GOV.S3.BLUEPRINT`

This Anchor:
; - May reference structure for contextual understanding only
; - MUST NOT redefine structure
; - MUST NOT define, expand, or reduce the Phase 5 Expected Set
; - MUST NOT drift from the Blueprint

If structure or expected items change:
; - `GOVERNANCE_COMPENDIUM.txt :: SECTION GOV.S3.BLUEPRINT` is updated first
; - This file is synchronized second

; ------------------------------------------------------------------
5. FINGERPRINT & VERIFICATION BEHAVIOR (DEFERRED)
; ------------------------------------------------------------------

All fingerprint rules, cache-busting behavior, and Fingerprint Challenge Mode (FCM) handling are defined in:

; - `GOVERNANCE_COMPENDIUM.txt :: SECTION GOV.S1.AI_INSTRUCTIONS`

This Anchor:
; - Acknowledges fingerprint supremacy
; - Does not restate enforcement logic
; - Does not introduce alternative validation rules

; ------------------------------------------------------------------
6. SYSTEM INTENT (NON-TECHNICAL ANCHOR)
; ------------------------------------------------------------------

The purpose of Pipz_Project_V3 is to:

; - Maintain deterministic behavior
; - Prevent inference-based drift
; - Enforce literal verification
; - Preserve long-term system integrity across sessions

The AI is a **verifier and executor**, never an estimator.

; ------------------------------------------------------------------
7. SYNCHRONIZATION OBLIGATION (MANDATORY)
; ------------------------------------------------------------------

Any change that affects:
; - Structure
; - Governance
; - Authority
; - Initialization
; - Verification semantics

MUST be synchronized across:
; - GOVERNANCE_COMPENDIUM.txt :: SECTION GOV.S3.BLUEPRINT
; - GOVERNANCE_COMPENDIUM.txt :: SECTION GOV.S4.ANCHOR_MASTER
; - GOVERNANCE_COMPENDIUM.txt :: SECTION GOV.S1.AI_INSTRUCTIONS
; - GOVERNANCE_COMPENDIUM.txt :: SECTION GOV.S7.INDEX_ID_LIST (when applicable)
; - GLOBAL_REGISTRY_MASTER.gsheet
; - GLOBAL_REGISTRY_MASTER.csv

Partial updates are invalid.

END OF PROJECT ANCHOR SECTION (SECTION A)

; ------------------------------------------------------------------
; SECTION B — PROJECT WORKING NOTES (DESIGN & RATIONALE)
; ------------------------------------------------------------------

PURPOSE OF THIS FILE SECTION
--------------------
This document exists to preserve:
- Design intent
- Non-obvious decisions
- Sanity checks
- “Why we did it this way”
- Guardrails against future regression

This file is NOT a checklist.
This file is NOT expected to be concise.
This file SHOULD grow over time.

; ------------------------------------------------------------------
CORE GOALS (DO NOT LOSE SIGHT OF THESE)
; ------------------------------------------------------------------

1. The user interacts with ONE assistant only (Architect).
2. All other AI roles are hidden, automated, and auditable.
3. Governance is enforced by code, not “AI good behavior.”
4. Drift is mechanically impossible, not just unlikely.
5. Every change is attributable, reviewable, and reversible.

If any future change weakens these goals, STOP.

; ------------------------------------------------------------------
WHY SIDECAR GOVERNANCE EXISTS
; ------------------------------------------------------------------

Some file formats are controlled by external tools:
- JSON
- lockfiles
- generated artifacts
- binaries

Governance MUST NEVER break tooling.

Therefore:
- Governance metadata moves to sidecar files
- Sidecars are authoritative
- Runtime artifacts remain pure

This is not a compromise — it is intentional architecture.

; ------------------------------------------------------------------
WHY NOT RELY ON CONTINUE / BUILT-IN AGENTS ALONE
; ------------------------------------------------------------------

Continue is powerful, but:
- It does not natively enforce hidden multi-model chaining
- It cannot prevent a model from “doing too much”
- It cannot hard-enforce mirroring or fingerprint rules

Therefore:
- Continue is treated as the Architect UI only
- Enforcement lives outside the model
- MCP / orchestrator handles invariants

; ------------------------------------------------------------------
ROLE SEPARATION INTENT
; ------------------------------------------------------------------

Architect:
- Thinks
- Plans
- Explains
- Is the ONLY user-facing AI
- NEVER writes directly

Executor:
- Implements literally
- No opinions
- No creativity
- Outputs full files by default

SubSupervisor:
- Mechanical checklist
- Objective PASS / FAIL
- Cannot be overridden

HeadSupervisor:
- Semantic correctness
- Architectural intent validation
- Risk detection
- Cannot override mechanical failure

; ------------------------------------------------------------------
RECENT KEY DECISIONS (IMPORTANT CONTEXT)
; ------------------------------------------------------------------

[2026-01-22]
- MVP orchestrator introduced with bootstrap-only behavior.
- No model calls, no file writes — audit-only.
- Establishes a safe, runnable baseline before hidden chaining is enabled.

[2026-01-22]
- JSON governance finalized via mandatory sidecar files:
  - package.json.governance.txt
  - tsconfig.json.governance.txt
- JSON remains pure and non-fingerprinted by embedded headers.

[2026-01-23]
- Completed port of MirrorAhkToTxt functionality into a VS Code extension:
  - Fingerprint updates on save (governed files, fail-closed gating)
  - Runtime mirroring (.ahk/.ini -> .txt) with AI SOT header
  - Standalone governed fingerprinting for additional file types
  - UTF-8 + UTF-16 mirror encoding compatibility
  - Audit logging into .ORCH_AUDITLOG\mirror\
- Extension packaged (VSIX) and installed into normal VS Code.
- Verified in normal VS Code (no Extension Development Host required for mirroring/fingerprints).

[2026-01-23]
- Noted VS Code Extension Development Host anomaly:
  - Dev Host could open files but refused to open folders/workspaces.
  - Debug console showed DisposableStore disposed warnings.
  - Gemini assisted in resolving the folder-open issue so development can continue.

; ------------------------------------------------------------------
COMMON FAILURE MODES TO WATCH FOR
; ------------------------------------------------------------------

- “We’ll remember to do X later” → NO
- “This file doesn’t need governance” → PROVE IT
- “The AI probably won’t touch that” → INVALID ASSUMPTION
- Silent tool behavior changes (VS Code / extensions)
- Header drift across file types
- JSON accidentally acquiring comments (must remain pure)

; ------------------------------------------------------------------
WHEN TO STOP AND REASSESS
; ------------------------------------------------------------------

STOP if:
- A tool change removes determinism
- A file bypasses governance
- A human must remember a rule instead of tooling enforcing it
- The user must manually switch AI roles for normal operation (end goal is hidden chaining)
- Audit logs become incomplete or optional

; ------------------------------------------------------------------
VS CODE EXTENSION REPACKAGING – DESIGN RATIONALE
; ------------------------------------------------------------------

The pipz-mirror-governance extension is not “just a tool”.
It is an ACTIVE GOVERNANCE ENFORCER.

Therefore:

- Any change to it can silently weaken guarantees if not rebuilt correctly
- VS Code does NOT auto-reload packaged extensions
- Extension Development Host ≠ real user environment

Because of this, a strict VSIX repackaging runbook was introduced.

Key principles enforced by the runbook:

1. BUILD IS EXPLICIT
   No implicit TypeScript transpilation is trusted.

2. INSTALL IS EXPLICIT
   The extension must be installed into the NORMAL VS Code instance,
   not assumed to be active because Dev Host worked.

3. VERIFICATION IS MANDATORY
   Mirroring, fingerprinting, encoding, and audit logging must be
   observed in real saves.

4. NO SILENT FAILURE
   If the extension fails to activate or log, work stops immediately.

This mirrors the broader project philosophy:

- Trust code, not memory
- Trust logs, not assumptions
- Trust enforcement, not intent

This runbook is deliberately repetitive and procedural.
That is a feature, not a flaw.

EXECUTION CHECKLIST (DETERMINISTIC)

This checklist defines the exact steps required to EXECUTE Phase 5
in SINGLE-ARTIFACT MODE.

This is NOT:
; - A report

; - An analysis
; - A narrative

This checklist is PROCEDURAL and MUST be followed in order.

No step may be skipped.  
No inference is permitted.  
Any failure requires STOP.

GOVERNANCE LAYER LOCK — DECLARATION OF STABLE STATE
; ------------------------------------------------------------------

(CANONICAL, NON-AUTHORITATIVE)

This document records a **governance lifecycle state transition** for Pipz_Project_V3.

It does NOT define rules.
It does NOT grant authority.
It does NOT override any governance mechanism.

Its sole purpose is to provide a **durable, verifiable record** that the governance layer
has entered a **stable, locked phase**.

; ------------------------------------------------------------------
1. GOVERNANCE LOCK STATUS
; ------------------------------------------------------------------

Status: **LOCKED (OPERATIONAL)**

As of this declaration:

; - The governance architecture for Pipz_Project_V3 is considered **stable**
; - Core governance rules are finalized, including implicit file resolution and constraint consultation rules
; - Initialization, verification, and enforcement semantics are fixed

The authoritative governance sources remain:

; - `GOVERNANCE_COMPENDIUM.txt :: SECTION GOV.S1.AI_INSTRUCTIONS`
; - `GOVERNANCE_COMPENDIUM.txt :: SECTION GOV.S2.BOOTSTRAP_V4`
; - `GOVERNANCE_COMPENDIUM.txt :: SECTION GOV.S3.BLUEPRINT`
; - `GOVERNANCE_COMPENDIUM.txt :: SECTION GOV.S4.ANCHOR_MASTER`
; - `GOVERNANCE_COMPENDIUM.txt :: SECTION GOV.S7.INDEX_ID_LIST`

This file does not participate in governance enforcement.

; ------------------------------------------------------------------
2. SCOPE OF THE LOCK
; ------------------------------------------------------------------

The following are considered **locked**:

; - Bootstrap v4 phase structure and semantics
; - Content-Fingerprint enforcement rules
; - GEMINI MEM TAG identity requirements
; - Stop-on-conflict behavior
; - Verification precedence rules
; - Phase 5 invocation boundaries

The following remain **permitted** without reopening governance:

; - Adding new files or modules to the project
; - Updating `GOVERNANCE_COMPENDIUM.txt :: SECTION GOV.S3.BLUEPRINT` to reflect structural extensions
; - Updating `GOVERNANCE_COMPENDIUM.txt :: SECTION GOV.S7.INDEX_ID_LIST` to reflect new resolvable items
; - Updating mirrors and fingerprints as part of normal operation

No change may alter **governance behavior** without explicitly reopening the governance layer.

; ------------------------------------------------------------------
3. WHAT THIS FILE IS NOT
; ------------------------------------------------------------------

This document:

; - Is NOT consulted during Bootstrap execution
; - Is NOT required for Bootstrap success
; - Is NOT used to resolve conflicts
; - Is NOT used to validate fingerprints
; - Is NOT referenced during Phase 5 execution
; - Is NOT a substitute for any governance file

In all conflicts, this file has **zero authority**.

; ------------------------------------------------------------------
4. GOVERNANCE REOPENING RULE (STRICT)
; ------------------------------------------------------------------

Reopening the governance layer requires **explicit, intentional action**.

A governance reopening MUST:

1. Be explicitly declared by the user

2. Result in a versioned update to:

   ; - `GOVERNANCE_COMPENDIUM.txt :: SECTION GOV.S1.AI_INSTRUCTIONS`
   ; - AND / OR `GOVERNANCE_COMPENDIUM.txt :: SECTION GOV.S2.BOOTSTRAP_V4`

3. Be accompanied by an updated declaration in this file

Absent those conditions, governance is considered locked.

; ------------------------------------------------------------------
5. INTENDED AUDIENCE
; ------------------------------------------------------------------

This file exists for:

; - Long-term project integrity
; - Future session clarity
; - Human verification
; - Audit traceability

It exists to prevent ambiguity — not to introduce it.

AUTHORITY NOTICE (MANDATORY)
; ------------------------------------------------------------------

This file provides deterministic Google Drive folder and file IDs to accelerate
indexing, traversal, and bootstrap operations.

This file is NOT a source of truth for:

; - File contents
; - Folder structure
; - Ownership
; - Logic
; - Governance
; - Verification outcomes

All content authority, verification, and conflict resolution is governed by:

; - GOVERNANCE_COMPENDIUM.txt :: SECTION GOV.S1.AI_INSTRUCTIONS
; - GOVERNANCE_COMPENDIUM.txt :: SECTION GOV.S3.BLUEPRINT
; - GOVERNANCE_COMPENDIUM.txt :: SECTION GOV.S4.ANCHOR_MASTER

Content-Fingerprint verification and GEMINI MEM TAG path validation are mandatory
for all files, even when Drive IDs are available.

; ------------------------------------------------------------------
VERIFIED COLUMN SEMANTICS (STRICT)
; ------------------------------------------------------------------

MICRO-RULE — NON-RESOLVABLE CONTENT CLASSIFICATION (MANDATORY)

Runtime artifacts, binary assets, and opaque data files that are not
opened, read, or governed as authoritative content MUST use:

; - VERIFIED = N/A

This includes, but is not limited to:

; - .ahk runtime scripts
; - .ini configuration files
; - Binary assets (e.g. .png, .ico)
; - Secrets or opaque data (e.g. license.key)

VERIFIED = YES is RESERVED exclusively for items whose contents are
meaningfully resolvable, inspectable, and auditable as governance inputs.

Marking non-resolvable content as VERIFIED = YES is prohibited.

The VERIFIED column indicates whether the listed Drive ID has been:

; - Successfully resolved via Google Drive
; - Confirmed to exist and be accessible
; - Confirmed to correspond to the declared PATH and TYPE

VERIFIED does NOT indicate:

; - Content correctness
; - Content freshness
; - Fingerprint validity
; - Governance compliance

Allowed values:

; - YES  → ID resolved and matched to declared path/type
; - NO   → ID known but not yet revalidated
; - N/A  → Non-resolvable content (e.g. runtime-only, ephemeral, or excluded)

VERIFIED status MUST NOT override:

; - GEMINI MEM TAG path declarations
; - Content-Fingerprint checks
; - Blueprint-defined structure
; - AI_PROJECT_INSTRUCTIONS enforcement

; ------------------------------------------------------------------
ID USAGE & PRECEDENCE RULES (STRICT)
; ------------------------------------------------------------------

1. File and folder IDs listed here MAY be used to:

   ; - Locate items deterministically
   ; - Enumerate child contents of folders
   ; - Accelerate indexing when Drive search is ambiguous or truncated

2. File and folder IDs listed here MUST NOT:

   ; - Override declared paths in GEMINI MEM TAG headers
   ; - Override structure defined in GOVERNANCE_COMPENDIUM.txt :: SECTION GOV.S3.BLUEPRINT
   ; - Override verification rules defined in GOVERNANCE_COMPENDIUM.txt :: SECTION GOV.S1.AI_INSTRUCTIONS

3. In all conflicts:

   ; - Declared path wins over ID
   ; - Content-Fingerprint wins over VERIFIED
   ; - Blueprint structure wins over ID
   ; - Governance rules win over all

IDs and VERIFIED flags are acceleration signals only, never authority.

ENTRY ID: PLC-0001
DATE (UTC): 2026-01-21
SCOPE: Governance
STATUS: CONFIRMED
TITLE: Google Drive preview truncates structured governance sections of GOVERNANCE_COMPENDIUM.txt unless formatting is normalized

CONTEXT:
AI governance and bootstrap files stored in Google Drive were intermittently unreadable or partially truncated when accessed via preview or connector-based reads.

DISCOVERY:
Google Drive preview and extraction systems may truncate or fail to fully render governance documents that contain dense structural formatting such as repeated ASCII delimiter blocks (e.g. "=====", "---"), mixed delimiter styles, or Markdown-like constructs, even when file size is small.

INVALIDATED APPROACH:
Storing governance sections of GOVERNANCE_COMPENDIUM.txt with mixed or stacked delimiters, Markdown horizontal rules, or long single-character separator blocks.

VALIDATED CONSTRAINT:
governance sections of GOVERNANCE_COMPENDIUM.txt must use a single, non-Markdown, commented delimiter style and avoid dense or mixed ASCII separator patterns to ensure full Drive preview and connector readability.

EVIDENCE:
Multiple governance sections of GOVERNANCE_COMPENDIUM.txt became fully readable in Drive only after delimiter normalization and removal of Markdown constructs; prior versions consistently truncated.

GOVERNANCE_COMPENDIUM.txt :: SECTION GOV.S3.BLUEPRINT
GOVERNANCE_COMPENDIUM.txt :: SECTION GOV.S4.ANCHOR_MASTER

NOTES:
This constraint was reproduced across multiple files and confirmed via Drive preview visibility to file end.

ENTRY ID: PLC-0002
DATE (UTC): 2026-01-21
SCOPE: CrossCutting
STATUS: CONFIRMED
TITLE: Canonical commented delimiter required for governance file stability

CONTEXT:
Multiple governance and audit files required normalization to ensure consistent readability and prevent Drive-based truncation.

DISCOVERY:
A single commented delimiter line is reliably treated as plain text by Google Drive preview and extraction systems, while legacy or Markdown-style delimiters are not.

INVALIDATED APPROACH:
Use of "=====", "---", mixed delimiter styles, or Markdown section separators in governance documents.

VALIDATED CONSTRAINT:
All governance and audit files must standardize on the canonical delimiter:
"; ------------------------------------------------------------------"

EVIDENCE:
After standardizing on this delimiter, all required governance sections of GOVERNANCE_COMPENDIUM.txt rendered fully in Drive preview and were readable end-to-end.

ENTRY ID: PLC-0003
DATE (UTC): 2026-01-21
SCOPE: CrossCutting
STATUS: CONFIRMED
TITLE: UTF-16 mis-decoding can cause intermittent GEMINI path extraction failures in mirroring scripts

CONTEXT:
MirrorAhkToTxt.py intermittently logged "missing project path in GEMINI MEM TAG; skipping mirror" even when the GEMINI MEM TAG line was present.

DISCOVERY:
If runtime text is decoded incorrectly (e.g., UTF-8 bytes mis-decoded as UTF-16), header scanning and regex extraction may fail inconsistently across saves, sometimes triggered by small whitespace changes.

INVALIDATED APPROACH:
Blindly attempting UTF-16 decoding first for all buffer text without BOM/NUL detection.

VALIDATED CONSTRAINT:
Text decoding in mirroring/fingerprinting utilities must be BOM/NUL-aware: only prefer UTF-16 when strongly indicated (BOM or NUL bytes); otherwise prefer UTF-8.

EVIDENCE:
Header/path extraction failures occurred inconsistently until BOM/NUL-aware decoding was used, after which mirroring behaved deterministically across whitespace-only edits.

ENTRY ID: PLC-0004
DATE (UTC): 2026-01-21
SCOPE: CrossCutting
STATUS: CONFIRMED
TITLE: AI SOT header must exist only in .txt mirrors, never in runtime .ahk/.ini files

CONTEXT:
MirrorAhkToTxt.py showed inconsistent behavior and false "missing project path" errors during fingerprint/mirror operations.

DISCOVERY:
Placing the AI SOT mirror header inside a runtime file (.ahk/.ini) can interfere with header scanning assumptions and lead to incorrect mirroring/fingerprinting behavior.

INVALIDATED APPROACH:
Including the AI SOT header block inside runtime files.

VALIDATED CONSTRAINT:
Runtime files (.ahk/.ini) must contain only the GEMINI MEM TAG + MAINTEMPLATE header (with Content-Fingerprint). The AI SOT header is reserved exclusively for .txt mirror outputs.

EVIDENCE:
Removing the AI SOT header from runtime files restored deterministic fingerprinting and mirroring behavior.

ENTRY ID: PLC-0005
DATE (UTC): 2026-01-21
SCOPE: CrossCutting
STATUS: CONFIRMED
TITLE: LLM whitespace cleanup can alter Python indentation and break MirrorAhkToTxt.py

CONTEXT:
MirrorAhkToTxt.py was passed through an external AI tool for "removing empty/unnecessary lines" to reduce visual bloat.

DISCOVERY:
LLM formatting passes can modify indentation or line structure even when instructed to only remove blank lines. In Python, indentation is semantic; accidental indentation changes can introduce syntax errors or change block structure.

INVALIDATED APPROACH:
Using an LLM to mass-remove blank lines or "normalize whitespace" in Python scripts without a deterministic verification step.

VALIDATED CONSTRAINT:
Whitespace cleanup for Python scripts must be mechanical and indentation-preserving (e.g., collapsing consecutive blank lines only) or must be followed by a strict syntax/indentation verification step before deployment.

EVIDENCE:
Gemini-cleaned MirrorAhkToTxt.py introduced an indentation change that required correction before the script could be treated as safe.

ENTRY ID: PLC-0006
DATE (UTC): 2026-01-25
SCOPE: Infrastructure
STATUS: CONFIRMED
TITLE: Google Drive .gsheet internal data is inaccessible to external connectors

CONTEXT:
Attempted use of Google Sheets as a live project registry for logic and state.

DISCOVERY:
The Google Drive API/connector exposes .gsheet files as metadata objects only; the tabular content (cells/tabs) is not streamable as raw text to the IDE or Gemini Code Assist.

INVALIDATED APPROACH:
Relying on .gsheet files for active project governance or state registries.

VALIDATED CONSTRAINT:
All project registries must exist as flat .csv files in the root registry directory to ensure visibility.

EVIDENCE:
Phase 2 Bootstrap failure on 2026-01-25; Agent reported file existence but "Zero content/Logic Blind" state.

RELATED FILES:

DATE (UTC): 2026-01-25
SCOPE: Tooling
STATUS: CONFIRMED
TITLE: Gemini Code Assist context window cannot parse multi-tab spreadsheet logic

CONTEXT:
Bootstrapping a project with complex registry dependencies involving multiple logic sheets.

DISCOVERY:
Current LLM tooling lacks the native ability to programmatically "switch tabs" or interpret spreadsheet-specific binary/XML formatting without high risk of hallucination.

INVALIDATED APPROACH:
Prompting the AI to "read Tab 2 of the registry sheet."

VALIDATED CONSTRAINT:
Governance data must be presented in flat, delimiter-heavy formats (CSV/TXT) to ensure high-fidelity LLM ingestion.

EVIDENCE:
Successful ingestion and audit only after transition to individual flat CSV files.

ENTRY ID: PLC-0008
DATE (UTC): 2026-01-25
SCOPE: Tooling
STATUS: CONFIRMED
TITLE: Gemini Code Assist Loop Detection Limit (Sequential Call Ceiling)

CONTEXT:
Sequential audit of 14+ files in a single turn using the code execution stream.

DISCOVERY:
The IDE execution stream triggers a 'loop_detected' error if sequential tool calls (read_file) exceed internal safety thresholds (~10-15 calls).

INVALIDATED APPROACH:
Running "Single-Sweep" audits or scans on more than 10 files in a single turn.

VALIDATED CONSTRAINT:
Automated processes must be segmented to reset the call counter every 5 operations.

EVIDENCE:
Error: "Unknown error from LLM stream: {'type':'loop_detected'}" encountered 2026-01-25.

RELATED FILES:
N/A

NOTES:
This is a technical safety ceiling of the Gemini Code Assist implementation.

ENTRY ID: PLC-0009
DATE (UTC): 2026-01-25
SCOPE: Audits
STATUS: CONFIRMED
TITLE: Mandatory Atomic Batching for Governance Verification

CONTEXT:
Performing Phase 5 Structural and Governance audits across a large codebase.

DISCOVERY:
Large-batch audits increase the risk of LLM "attention drift," leading to overlooked header errors or session timeouts.

INVALIDATED APPROACH:
Conducting full-project governance scans in a single prompt.

VALIDATED CONSTRAINT:
All governance audits must be executed in "Atomic Batches" of exactly 5 files to ensure 1:1 literal verification.

EVIDENCE:
PLC-0008 technical limitation; verification of 5-file batches results in 100% accuracy.

; ------------------------------------------------------------------

ENTRY ID: PLC-0010
DATE (UTC): 2026-01-27
SCOPE: AutoHotkey v2 Logic
STATUS: CONFIRMED
TITLE: SetTimer Static Method Callback Failure

CONTEXT:
Attempting to trigger a debounced log or function call using SetTimer within a static class method (e.g., Messenger.PushTitleUpdate).

DISCOVERY:
In AHK v2, referencing a static method as `this.MethodName` or `ClassName.MethodName` inside a `SetTimer` call throws "Error: Invalid callback function." The interpreter does not automatically treat these as Func objects in this context.

INVALIDATED APPROACH:
`SetTimer(this.MethodName, -1000)` or `SetTimer(Messenger.MethodName, -1000)`

EVIDENCE:
Runtime error thrown consistently in Pipz_Project_V3 Controller whenever the Game Window Title field was modified.

RELATED FILES:
Pipz_Project_V3\Controller\Modules\Messenger.ahk

NOTES:
This constraint is critical for maintaining stable execution of AHK v2 scripts that rely on timed callbacks within static methods.

; ------------------------------------------------------------------

ENTRY ID: PLC-0011
DATE (UTC): 2026-01-27
SCOPE: AutoHotkey v2 Logic
STATUS: CONFIRMED
TITLE: Mandatory Method Binding for Class-Based Timers

CONTEXT:
Ensuring valid callbacks for SetTimer when the target function resides within a Class.

VALIDATED CONSTRAINT:
When passing a class method to `SetTimer`, it MUST be explicitly bound to the class or instance object to create a "BoundFunc" object.

VALIDATED APPROACH:
`SetTimer(ClassName.MethodName.Bind(ClassName), -1000)`

EVIDENCE:
Successful execution of the timer callback without errors in Pipz_Project_V3 Controller after applying the `.Bind()` method.

RELATED FILES:
Pipz_Project_V3\Controller\Modules\Messenger.ahk

NOTES:
This ensures the callback is recognized as a valid callable object by the AHK v2 runtime, regardless of whether the method actually requires the `this` parameter.

; ------------------------------------------------------------------

ENTRY ID: PLC-0012
DATE (UTC): 2026-01-28
SCOPE: Governance
STATUS: CONFIRMED
TITLE: Policy-B governed registry model with non-governed internal function index

CONTEXT:
The project governance layer was being updated following consolidation of modules
into core container files (Controller_Core, Worker_Core, Core_Utils, Humanoid, Interop),
and the introduction of a new INTERNAL_FUNCTION_INDEX.csv for full symbol discovery.

DISCOVERY:
Requiring all functions, variables, and helpers to be registered in a governed registry
creates excessive governance churn and hard-stops during refactors, consolidation,
and internal reorganization. Additionally, section-based registry assumptions
(GLOBAL_STATE_REGISTRY, GLOBAL_FUNCTION_REGISTRY, etc.) coupled to .gsheet sources
are incompatible with tooling visibility constraints.

INVALIDATED APPROACH:
Treating a monolithic or section-based registry (including gsheet-only registries)
as the authoritative source for all functions, variables, and logic.

VALIDATED CONSTRAINT:
The project SHALL use a dual-registry model:
- GLOBAL_REGISTRY_MASTER.csv is the authoritative, CSV-first, Policy-B governed registry.
- INTERNAL_FUNCTION_INDEX.csv is a non-governed, regenerable symbol inventory.

Policy-B governance applies ONLY to:
- Entrypoints (startup paths, externally-triggered handlers)
- Timers (SetTimer callbacks)
- OnMessage handlers / IPC receivers
- IPC sender contracts and encodings
- Settings IO and Defaults interface
- Lifecycle and process controls
- Logic invariants directly tied to the above surface area

Internal helpers and non-surface logic MUST NOT require governed registration.

EVIDENCE:
Governance refactor eliminated stale module references, reduced registry churn,
and aligned registry verification with tooling-readable CSV artifacts while preserving
auditability of governance-critical surface area.

FILE TYPE = .json
MANDATED HEADER STYLE = NONE (JSON FILES MUST REMAIN PURE)

RATIONALE:
- JSON does NOT support comments.
- package.json, tsconfig.json, and similar files are parsed by strict toolchains
  (npm, Node, TypeScript, VS Code extension host).
- ANY header or comment inside a .json file WILL break tooling.

GOVERNANCE REQUIREMENT (MANDATORY):

ALL GOVERNED .json FILES MUST USE A SIDECAR GOVERNANCE FILE.

SIDECAR FILE NAMING RULE:
- <original_filename>.governance.txt

EXAMPLES:
- package.json               → package.json.governance.txt
- tsconfig.json              → tsconfig.json.governance.txt
- settings.schema.json       → settings.schema.json.governance.txt

SIDECAR FILE REQUIREMENTS:
- MUST contain a full MAINTEMPLATE header (standard .txt format)
- MUST include GEMINI MEM TAG with FULL PATH pointing to the SIDECAR FILE
- MUST reference the governed JSON file explicitly in content
- MUST receive Content-Fingerprint updates on save
- MUST be listed in GOVERNANCE_COMPENDIUM.txt :: SECTION GOV.S7.INDEX_ID_LIST as the authoritative governance artifact

THE .json FILE ITSELF:
- MUST remain valid, comment-free JSON
- MUST NOT contain governance metadata
- IS CONSIDERED A RUNTIME / TOOL-CONSTRAINED ARTIFACT

FILE TYPE = .ahk
MANDATED HEADER STYLE =

; ------------------------------------------------------------------
; GEMINI MEM TAG (DO NOT EVER REMOVE OR EDIT) - MY FULL PATH IS "Pipz_Project_V3\<RELATIVE\PATH\FILENAME>.ahk"

; ALL CONTENT MUST GO BELOW THIS POINT(LINES 1-14 RESERVED)
; ------------------------------------------------------------------

; ------------------------------------------------------------------
; SIGNPOST GOVERNANCE (AHK ONLY)
; ------------------------------------------------------------------
; DIRECTIVES (AI-ONLY | DO NOT COPY INTO FILE SIGNPOSTS):
; - The signpost block must be placed at the TOP of the file’s content area
;   (immediately after the 14-line reserved header region).
; - The USER does NOT fill this out. The AI fills this out when a new file/module
;   is created or when a file’s governance surface changes.
; - The signpost is COMMENT-ONLY. It must never require touching or reformatting
;   executable code to remain valid.
; - The signpost must be factual and implementation-linked (names, callbacks, IDs).
; - Use "N/A" explicitly if a section does not apply (never delete headings).
; - Do not include speculative future behavior; document what exists now.
; - Any signpost output that includes DIRECTIVES is invalid and must be corrected.
;
; POLICY-B DIRECTIVES (AI-ONLY):
; - GLOBAL_REGISTRY_MASTER.csv is the authoritative governed registry (Policy-B).
; - INTERNAL_FUNCTION_INDEX.csv is NON-GOVERNED and exists only for full symbol discovery.
; - The AI MUST consult GLOBAL_REGISTRY_MASTER.csv before changing:
;     * entrypoints, timers, OnMessage/IPC handlers, IPC contracts, lifecycle controls,
;       settings IO, or defaults interface behavior.
; - The AI MUST NOT require a governed registry update for internal helper changes.
; - Missing or drifting entries in INTERNAL_FUNCTION_INDEX.csv are never a hard-stop.
; - If you add/remove a timer, OnMessage, IPC contract, lifecycle control, or
;   settings/defaults interface, you MUST update GLOBAL_REGISTRY_MASTER.csv.

; MODULE NAME:
;   <Short module name> (<Entrypoint | Core Container | Shared Lib | Utility>)
;
; WHAT IT OWNS / CONTROLS:
;   - <Subsystem #1>
;   - <Subsystem #2>
;   - <Subsystem #3>
;
; INPUTS (events/messages/functions it responds to):
;   - GUI events: N/A | <Button/Control> -> <Handler>
;   - Windows messages: N/A | OnMessage(<MSG_ID>, <Handler>)
;   - Timers: N/A | SetTimer(<Callback>, <interval>)
;   - Direct calls: N/A | <PublicFunction>(...) called by <OwnerFile>
;
; OUTPUTS / SIDE EFFECTS (files, settings, processes, IPC, UI):
;   - UI: N/A | <What it changes in GUI/overlay>
;   - Settings / Files:
;       * Reads: N/A | <files>
;       * Writes: N/A | <files>
;   - IPC:
;       * Receives: N/A | <message IDs / mechanism>
;       * Sends: N/A | <message IDs / mechanism>
;   - Process control: N/A | <launch/kill/suspend/resume + how>
;
; DEPENDENCIES (globals/functions it relies on):
;   - Includes: N/A | <List included modules>
;   - Globals it expects: N/A | <g_* and shared objects>
;   - External APIs / DllCall: N/A | <if any>
;
; GOVERNANCE NOTES (hard-stop rules, invariants, what must remain true):
;   - <Invariant #1: “must always…”>
;   - <Invariant #2: “must never…”>
;   - Registry note:
;       * If any new entrypoints/IPC/timers/lifecycle controls are added here,
;         GLOBAL_REGISTRY_MASTER.csv must be updated (Policy-B surface area only).
;
; EXPORTED SURFACE (registry-relevant quicklist):
;   - N/A | <OnMessage handler #1>
;   - N/A | <Timer callback #1>
;   - N/A | <IPC sender/receiver #1>
;   - N/A | <Lifecycle control #1>

; GLOBAL GOVERNANCE NOTE (APPLIES TO ALL FILE TYPES)
; ------------------------------------------------------------------

; If a file format is controlled by an external compiler, interpreter,
; or toolchain and does not safely support comments or headers,
; governance metadata MUST NOT be embedded directly.

; In such cases, governance MUST be implemented via:
; - a sidecar .governance.txt file, OR
; - a mirrored authoritative text file, OR
; - a registry entry (as defined in AI_PROJECT_INSTRUCTIONS)

; GOVERNANCE IS NEVER ALLOWED TO BREAK TOOLING.

; If a conflict exists between governance format and tool requirements:
; - TOOL COMPATIBILITY WINS
; - GOVERNANCE MOVES TO A SIDE CHANNEL
