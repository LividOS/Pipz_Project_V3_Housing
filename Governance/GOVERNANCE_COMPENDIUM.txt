GOVERNANCE COMPENDIUM — AUTHORITATIVE DECLARATION

This document, GOVERNANCE_COMPENDIUM.txt, is the sole authoritative governance artifact for Pipz_Project_V3 in single-artifact mode.

All prior standalone governance files are represented as deterministic sections within this document.

Any rule, protocol, or hard-stop condition that previously depended on the existence or readability of a separate governance file now depends on the existence and full readability of:
  - GOVERNANCE_COMPENDIUM.txt, and
  - the relevant governance section(s) identified by their stable Section IDs.

If the compendium or any required section cannot be located or fully read, governed operations MUST STOP.

Archived originals are stored separately under /Archive and are non-operative.

; ------------------------------------------------------------------
### GOV.S0.A — SECTION ID CONTRACT (STABLE IDENTITIES)
; ------------------------------------------------------------------

The following Section IDs are case-sensitive, immutable, and must never be aliased:

- GOV.S1.AI_INSTRUCTIONS  (origin: AI_PROJECT_INSTRUCTIONS.txt)
- GOV.S2.BOOTSTRAP_V4  (origin: BOOTSTRAPv4.txt)
- GOV.S3.BLUEPRINT  (origin: _PROJECT_BLUEPRINT.txt)
- GOV.S4.ANCHOR_MASTER  (origin: _PROJECT_ANCHOR_MASTER.txt)
- GOV.S5.PHASE5_AUDIT  (origin: PHASE5_AUDIT_MASTER.txt)
- GOV.S6.GOVERNANCE_LOCK  (origin: GOVERNANCE_LOCK.txt)
- GOV.S7.INDEX_ID_LIST  (origin: INDEXIDLIST.txt)
- GOV.S8.LEARNED_CONSTRAINTS  (origin: PROJECT_LEARNED_CONSTRAINTS.txt)
- GOV.S9.STANDARD_HEADERS  (origin: STANDARDIZED_HEADERS.txt)

; ------------------------------------------------------------------
### GOV.S0.B — ARCHIVED ORIGINAL CONTENT (EXTERNAL — NON-OPERATIVE)
; ------------------------------------------------------------------

Original standalone governance files have been removed from this document and
are preserved exclusively under the project-level /Archive directory.

Archived originals exist solely for:
  - historical reference
  - literal fidelity cross-checking
  - audit traceability against prior standalone artifacts (now represented as sections)

Archived originals are NON-AUTHORITATIVE and MUST NOT be used for:
  - governance reasoning
  - enforcement decisions
  - STOP / hard-stop evaluation
  - semantic interpretation
  - proposal justification
  - path, identity, or file-existence assertions

Operative governance semantics for single-artifact mode are defined
exclusively by the OPERATIVE TEXT (COMPENDIUM MODE) sections
within this document.

; ------------------------------------------------------------------
### GOV.S0.C — REGISTRY AUTHORITY NOTICE (EXTERNAL)
; ------------------------------------------------------------------

The following artifacts are authoritative registries and are intentionally NOT embedded as compendium sections:
  - GLOBAL_REGISTRY_MASTER.csv (Policy-B governed surface)
  - INTERNAL_FUNCTION_INDEX.csv (non-governed symbol index)
  - GLOBAL_REGISTRY_MASTER.gsheet (backup vault only, if referenced)

Any governance rule that requires registry verification continues to require these artifacts externally. If a required registry cannot be located or read, the original hard-stop semantics apply unchanged.

; ------------------------------------------------------------------
### GOV.S0.D — INTERPRETATION & CONFLICT RULES (MANDATORY)
; ------------------------------------------------------------------

IR-1. Archived original governance content exists exclusively outside this document
     (under the project-level /Archive directory) and solely for:
     - historical reference
     - literal fidelity verification
     - audit traceability against prior standalone artifacts (now represented as sections)

IR-2. Archived original content MUST NOT be used for:
     - governance reasoning
     - enforcement decisions
     - STOP / hard-stop evaluation
     - proposal justification
     - semantic interpretation
     - path, identity, or file-existence assertions

IR-3. OPERATIVE TEXT (COMPENDIUM MODE) within this document is the ONLY valid source
     for active governance semantics in single-artifact mode.

IR-4. If any semantic, procedural, or enforcement conflict is detected between:
     - archived original content (external), and
     - OPERATIVE TEXT (COMPENDIUM MODE)

     The conflict MUST be explicitly reported.
     The AI MUST NOT resolve the conflict implicitly, heuristically,
     or by precedence assumption.

IR-5. A governance section within GOVERNANCE_COMPENDIUM.txt is considered UNREADABLE if:
     - it cannot be fully located, OR
     - it is truncated, partially visible, or cut off

     Partial readability SHALL be treated as unreadable for all enforcement purposes
     and MUST trigger the same STOP conditions as total absence.

; ------------------------------------------------------------------
### GOV.S0.E — WORKING_SET_CAP — Working Set (Live) Hard Cap (20 Files)
; ------------------------------------------------------------------

DEFINITIONS:

Working Set (Live):
- Files present in the ChatGPT Project “Files” area (project-scoped), treated as the authoritative live context.
- The AI must treat only this set as “in-session reality” unless the user explicitly imports additional artifacts.

Backend Set (Cold):
- All other project artifacts stored outside the live Project Files area (GitHub, Drive, archives, bundles, snapshots).
- These may be referenced, but MUST NOT be treated as live reality unless imported into Working Set (Live).

HARD CAP:

1) Working Set (Live) MUST NOT exceed 20 files.
2) If a change would exceed 20:
   a) User must demote one or more files to Backend Set (Cold), OR
   b) User must consolidate content into existing Working Set files (under existing governance).
3) AI MUST NOT request imports that would exceed the cap.
4) If compliance cannot be achieved, STOP and request a demotion/consolidation decision.

RATIONALE (non-normative):
- Prevents context sprawl and reduces drift risk.

INVOCATION: BUILD UPDATED

When the user states: "BUILD UPDATED"

The AI MUST:
1) Re-read ALL Working Set (Live) files present in the Project Files area.
2) Confirm rehydration completion.
3) Read the current pointer file and report:
   - BUILD_ID: <value>
   - UPDATED_UTC: <value>

The AI MUST NOT report BUILD_ID/UPDATED_UTC until after step (1) is complete.
If any Working Set file cannot be read, governed operations MUST STOP.

CURRENT WORKING SET (Count : 15):
- Pipz_Project_V3/Governance/GOVERNANCE_COMPENDIUM.txt
- Pipz_Project_V3/Governance/PROJECT_WORKING_NOTES.txt
- Pipz_Project_V3/Governance/PROJECT_LEARNED_CONSTRAINTS.txt
- Pipz_Project_V3/Governance/PROTOCOL_RUNBOOK.txt
- Pipz_Project_V3/Governance/PIPZ_POINTER.txt
- Pipz_Project_V3/PPAVP/PROJECT_STATUS_CHECKLIST.txt

- Pipz_Project_V3/Lib/Core_Utils.txt
- Pipz_Project_V3/Lib/Interop.txt
- Pipz_Project_V3/Lib/Humanoid.txt

CURRENT BACKEND SET (Count : 3) [INFORMATIONAL ONLY — NOT ENFORCED]:

; ------------------------------------------------------------------
; ALL CONTENT MUST GO BELOW THIS POINT(LINES 1-14 RESERVED)
; ------------------------------------------------------------------

; ------------------------------------------------------------------
### GOV.S1.A — BOOTSTRAP v4 — CONVERSATION INITIALIZATION PROTOCOL (MANDATORY)
; ------------------------------------------------------------------

Bootstrap v4 is a mandatory conversation initialization protocol for Pipz_Project_V3.

Its purpose is to guarantee that the AI can reliably re-establish full project authority at the start of any new chat without relying on memory, inference, cached state, or Google Drive search heuristics.

Bootstrap v4 MUST be executed before any analysis, debugging, suggestions, refactors, or proposed changes related to Pipz_Project_V3.

; ------------------------------------------------------------------
### GOV.S1.B — BOOTSTRAP ARTIFACT REFERENCE RULE (CANONICAL — SINGLE-ARTIFACT MODE)
; ------------------------------------------------------------------

The canonical, authoritative definition of the Bootstrap v4 protocol is:

; - GOVERNANCE_COMPENDIUM.txt :: SECTION GOV.S2.BOOTSTRAP_V4

Rules:

B1. At the start of every new chat related to Pipz_Project_V3, after completing
    PHASE 0 of this section, the AI MUST locate, open, and fully read:

    ; - GOVERNANCE_COMPENDIUM.txt :: SECTION GOV.S2.BOOTSTRAP_V4

B2. Bootstrap v4 MUST be executed strictly according to the operative text
    contained in GOVERNANCE_COMPENDIUM.txt :: SECTION GOV.S2.BOOTSTRAP_V4.

B3. Any archived, historical, summarized, or duplicated Bootstrap content
    elsewhere in the compendium is NON-AUTHORITATIVE.

B4. The declaration:
    "BOOTSTRAP v4 COMPLETE — Pipz_Project_V3 authority established."
    is VALID only if the above section has been read in full during the
    current session.

B5. If GOVERNANCE_COMPENDIUM.txt or the required section cannot be located,
    fully read, or verified (including Content-Fingerprint), the AI MUST STOP.

; ------------------------------------------------------------------
### GOV.S1.C — BOOTSTRAP v4 ENFORCEMENT GATE (ABSOLUTE)
; ------------------------------------------------------------------

E1. Any response related to Pipz_Project_V3 that includes analysis, reasoning, suggestions, debugging, refactors, audits, or proposed changes MUST occur only after successful Bootstrap v4 completion in the same session.

E2. Successful Bootstrap v4 completion is defined exclusively as:

    ; - Full execution of Phases 0–4 as defined in GOVERNANCE_COMPENDIUM.txt :: SECTION GOV.S2.BOOTSTRAP_V4, AND
    ; - Emission of the exact declaration:

      "BOOTSTRAP v4 COMPLETE — Pipz_Project_V3 authority established."

E3. If the declaration has not been emitted in the current session:

    ; - The AI MUST NOT proceed
    ; - The AI MUST instruct the user to initiate or allow Bootstrap v4 execution
    ; - The AI MUST NOT infer prior completion, even if files appear unchanged

E4. Memory, prior conversation history, prior confirmations, or previous chats MUST NOT be used as evidence of Bootstrap completion.

E5. This rule applies to:

    ; - New chats
    ; - Resumed chats
    ; - Long-running chats after context loss
    ; - Any situation where authority cannot be freshly proven

; ------------------------------------------------------------------
### GOV.S1.D — BOOTSTRAP v4 INVOCATION TOKEN REQUIREMENT (ABSOLUTE)
; ------------------------------------------------------------------

For any new chat session related to Pipz_Project_V3, the user's FIRST message MUST include
a machine-checkable invocation token.

Two invocation formats are permitted.

FORMAT 1 — FULL CANONICAL INVOCATION:

BOOTSTRAP_V4_INIT
This project is defined in my Google Drive under Pipz_Project_V3.
Locate GOVERNANCE_COMPENDIUM.txt :: SECTION GOV.S1.AI_INSTRUCTIONS
and initiate Bootstrap v4.

FORMAT 2 — TOKEN-ONLY INVOCATION:

BOOTSTRAP_V4_INIT

Rules:

T1. The first non-empty line of the user's first message MUST be exactly:

    BOOTSTRAP_V4_INIT

T2. If additional lines are present after the token, they MUST be exactly:

    This project is defined in my Google Drive under Pipz_Project_V3.
    Locate GOVERNANCE_COMPENDIUM.txt :: SECTION GOV.S1.AI_INSTRUCTIONS and initiate Bootstrap v4.

T3. FORMAT 2 (token-only) is explicitly permitted and does NOT require
    the presence of the canonical text lines.

T4. If the token is missing, malformed, reordered, or paraphrased:

    ; - The AI MUST STOP.
    ; - The AI MUST request the user to resend a valid invocation.
    ; - The AI MUST NOT assume a Drive-backed project exists.
    ; - The AI MUST NOT initiate Bootstrap v4.

T5. Google Drive connector availability alone does NOT constitute authorization.

T6. This token requirement exists to guarantee:

    ; - Clean cold-start behavior.
    ; - No reliance on memory.
    ; - Deterministic bootstrap execution across AI platforms.

; ------------------------------------------------------------------
### GOV.S1.E — CONTEXT SNAPSHOT POINTER (NON-AUTHORITATIVE)
; ------------------------------------------------------------------

`PIPZ_POINTER.txt` defines a non-authoritative routing hint to a read-only project snapshot (context bundle) intended solely to improve AI visibility into the current project state.

The pointer and referenced bundle:
- MUST NOT be treated as a source of governance authority.
- MUST NOT override or contradict any canonical governance artifacts, including:
  - GOVERNANCE_COMPENDIUM.txt
  - PROTOCOL_RUNBOOK.txt
  - GLOBAL_REGISTRY_MASTER.csv
- MAY be used to determine file presence and contents for analysis only.

If any content retrieved via the pointer contradicts a canonical governance artifact → STOP.
This condition indicates a tooling or publishing fault, not a governance change request.

; ------------------------------------------------------------------
PHASE 0 — GOVERNANCE GATE
; ------------------------------------------------------------------

The AI MUST:
0.1 Locate, open, and fully read:

    ; - GOVERNANCE_COMPENDIUM.txt :: SECTION GOV.S1.AI_INSTRUCTIONS (VIRTUAL FILE — REQUIRED)
	
0.2 Verify:

    ; - Presence of GEMINI MEM TAG
    ; - Presence of Content-Fingerprint
    ; - Fingerprint is readable and well-formed
	
0.3 Obey all rules defined in this file, including:

    ; - Mandatory re-verification
    ; - Fingerprint precedence
    ; - Stop-on-conflict behavior
    ; - Hidden Permanence Confirmation Rule (Rule 16)

STOP CONDITIONS:

; - File cannot be opened
; - File is truncated
; - Fingerprint is missing or malformed
; - Any rule cannot be satisfied

; ------------------------------------------------------------------
PHASE 0.5 — FINGERPRINT ENFORCEMENT INVARIANT (ABSOLUTE)
; ------------------------------------------------------------------

At no point during Bootstrap v4 may any governed file be reasoned about,
interpreted, or used for decision-making prior to successful verification
of its declared Content-Fingerprint.

Temporary access, partial reads, or structural inspection without completed
fingerprint verification are prohibited and MUST trigger STOP.

Hierarchy Clarification:

PHASE 0.5 establishes a GLOBAL gating invariant.
Rules governing fingerprint mechanics (cache-busting,
declaration ordering, or response formatting) operate
ONLY after this gate is satisfied.

No reasoning, inspection, or classification is permitted
prior to successful PHASE 0.5 completion.

; ------------------------------------------------------------------
PHASE 1 — ROOT RESOLUTION
; ------------------------------------------------------------------

Bootstrap v4 MUST NOT rely on Google Drive search alone.

Root resolution precedence is STRICT:

1) GOVERNANCE_COMPENDIUM.txt :: SECTION GOV.S7.INDEX_ID_LIST (if present)
2) GEMINI MEM TAG declared paths
3) GOVERNANCE_COMPENDIUM.txt :: SECTION GOV.S3.BLUEPRINT defined structure
4) Google Drive search (LAST RESORT ONLY)

Drive IDs provide deterministic location only and do not establish content truth.
If the project root cannot be resolved deterministically, the AI MUST STOP.

; ------------------------------------------------------------------
PHASE 2 — CANONICAL GOVERNANCE SET VERIFICATION (SINGLE-ARTIFACT MODE)
; ------------------------------------------------------------------

Governance sections are treated as VIRTUAL FILES and must be fully readable.
The AI MUST verify the following authoritative governance sources:

; - GOVERNANCE_COMPENDIUM.txt :: SECTION GOV.S1.AI_INSTRUCTIONS
; - GOVERNANCE_COMPENDIUM.txt :: SECTION GOV.S3.BLUEPRINT
; - GOVERNANCE_COMPENDIUM.txt :: SECTION GOV.S4.ANCHOR_MASTER
; - GOVERNANCE_COMPENDIUM.txt :: SECTION GOV.S7.INDEX_ID_LIST
; - GLOBAL_REGISTRY_MASTER (AUTHORITY HIERARCHY):
    1. PRIMARY: GLOBAL_REGISTRY_MASTER.csv (Authoritative governed registry, Policy-B)
    2. FALLBACK: GLOBAL_REGISTRY_MASTER.gsheet (Backup Vault ONLY — may be unreadable to tooling)

Each file must:

; - Be readable in full
; - Declare Content-Fingerprint where applicable
; - Match declared identity
; - [REGISTRY SPECIFIC]:
;     - Verify GLOBAL_REGISTRY_MASTER.csv is readable in full.
;     - Verify it represents Policy-B governed surface area only (entrypoints/timers/IPC/lifecycle/settings/defaults).
;     - Verify INTERNAL_FUNCTION_INDEX.csv exists if referenced by the task, but it is non-governed and not a hard stop.

STOP CONDITIONS:

; - Any file is missing
; - Any file is unreadable or truncated
; - GLOBAL_REGISTRY_MASTER.csv is missing or desynchronized AND .gsheet fallback is inaccessible
; - Any required registry section is inaccessible

; ------------------------------------------------------------------
PHASE 3 — STRUCTURE RECONSTRUCTION
; ------------------------------------------------------------------

Using only authoritative declarations, the AI reconstructs the expected project structure, including:

; - Root directory
; - Governance directory
; - Registry directory
; - Controller, Worker, and Lib subdirectories (as defined by GOVERNANCE_COMPENDIUM.txt :: SECTION GOV.S3.BLUEPRINT)
; - Required .txt mirrors
; - Required runtime counterparts

This phase establishes what MUST exist, not what Drive happens to expose.
Inference, assumption, or memory-based reconstruction is prohibited.

; ------------------------------------------------------------------
PHASE 4 — VERIFICATION DECLARATION
; ------------------------------------------------------------------

Only after Phases 0–3 succeed may the AI:

; - Declare Bootstrap v4 completion
; - Proceed with analysis, debugging, or code work

All subsequent responses MUST continue to obey:

; - Fingerprint declaration rules
; - Stop-on-conflict rules
; - No inference / no assumption rules

; ------------------------------------------------------------------
PHASE 5 — FULL VISIBILITY & ACCESSIBILITY AUDIT (OPTIONAL)
; ------------------------------------------------------------------

Phase 5 is an optional extension to Bootstrap v4.
Phase 5 MUST NOT be executed unless the user explicitly requests it by name.

Phase 5 MUST NEVER be:

; - Implied
; - Assumed
; - Auto-invoked
; - Triggered as part of Bootstrap v4
; - Executed due to partial failure, uncertainty, or missing Drive visibility

Phase 5 does not establish governance correctness.

; ------------------------------------------------------------------
PHASE 5 — PURPOSE
; ------------------------------------------------------------------

When invoked, Phase 5 performs a full recursive audit of the project's Google Drive presence to determine:

; - Which directories and files exist
; - Which are readable
; - Which are missing
; - Which are orphaned
; - Which are mis-located
; - Which are ungoverned
; - Which are inaccessible due to permissions or indexing failures

; ------------------------------------------------------------------
PHASE 5 — EXECUTION RULES
; ------------------------------------------------------------------

Phase 5 execution MUST follow the operative text in
GOVERNANCE_COMPENDIUM.txt :: SECTION GOV.S5.PHASE5_AUDIT (VIRTUAL FILE).

5.1 Root-Anchored Traversal
; - Enumeration MUST begin from the resolved project root folder ID
; - Child discovery MUST use parent-child traversal
; - Google Drive search MUST NOT be used for discovery

5.2 Recursive Enumeration
For every folder:

; - Enumerate all files and subfolders
; - Record Drive ID, name, parent ID, and type
; - Attempt to open readable files

5.3 Path Reconstruction
For every discovered item:

; - Rebuild full path by walking parents to root
; - Compare against:

  ; - GEMINI MEM TAG paths
  ; - Blueprint-defined expected locations

5.4 Reconciliation
Compare:

1) Expected set (Blueprint + Anchor)
2) Discovered set (Drive traversal)
3) Indexed set (INDEXIDLIST)

Classify each item as:

; - VERIFIED
; - UNREADABLE
; - MISSING
; - ORPHANED
; - UNGOVERNED

; ------------------------------------------------------------------
PHASE 5 — OUTPUT
; ------------------------------------------------------------------

Phase 5 produces a read-only audit report.

Phase 5 MUST NOT:

; - Modify files
; - Create mirrors
; - Update registries
; - Repair structure

Failures in Phase 5 DO NOT invalidate Bootstrap v4 but MUST be explicitly reported.

; ------------------------------------------------------------------
POLICY-B GOVERNANCE MODEL (MANDATORY)
; ------------------------------------------------------------------

The project uses a dual-layer registry system to balance strict governance with
practical development velocity.

----------------------------------------
A) GLOBAL_REGISTRY_MASTER.csv (Policy-B)
----------------------------------------

GLOBAL_REGISTRY_MASTER.csv is the authoritative governed registry.

It is POLICY-B scoped, meaning it MUST contain ONLY governance-critical surface area:

- Entrypoints (startup paths, GUI entrypoints, externally-triggered handlers)
- Timers (SetTimer callbacks)
- OnMessage handlers / IPC receivers
- IPC sender contracts and message encodings
- Settings IO and Defaults interface
- Lifecycle and process controls
- Logic invariants directly tied to the above surface area

The governed registry is:
- CSV-first
- Tooling-readable
- Deterministic
- A hard-stop authority for governed surface changes

The AI MUST consult this registry before:
- Modifying any governed surface item
- Introducing new timers, IPC handlers, entrypoints, or lifecycle controls

----------------------------------------
B) INTERNAL_FUNCTION_INDEX.csv (NON-GOVERNED)
----------------------------------------

INTERNAL_FUNCTION_INDEX.csv is a NON-GOVERNED, informational index.

It exists to:
- Provide a complete symbol inventory (functions, methods, classes)
- Aid navigation, search, and refactors
- Avoid forcing governance churn for internal helpers

Rules:
- It may be regenerated at any time.
- It may drift.
- It MUST NOT cause hard stops.
- It MUST NOT be treated as authoritative governance.

The AI MAY use this file for discovery and orientation, but MUST NOT:
- Require registry updates based solely on internal helper changes
- Treat missing entries here as violations

----------------------------------------
C) AI OBLIGATIONS (CRITICAL)
----------------------------------------

The AI MUST:
- Enforce Policy-B boundaries strictly.
- Update or flag registry changes ONLY when governed surface area changes.
- Avoid expanding governance scope into internal implementation details.
- Use signposts and the governed registry together to understand ownership and invariants.

The AI MUST NOT:
- Reintroduce section-based registry assumptions.
- Require all functions or variables to appear in a governed registry.
- Treat INTERNAL_FUNCTION_INDEX.csv as a hard-stop authority.

----------------------------------------
D) CONFLICT RESOLUTION
----------------------------------------

If a conflict exists between:
- Code
- GLOBAL_REGISTRY_MASTER.csv
- Signpost declarations

The AI must:
1) Flag the conflict explicitly.
2) Propose reconciliation options.
3) Wait for confirmation before proceeding.

----------------------------------------
E) INTERACTION WITH GOVERNANCE COMPENDIUM (MANDATORY)
----------------------------------------

In single-artifact mode, all conflict handling MUST comply with
GOV.S0.COMPENDIUM_META — INTERPRETATION & CONFLICT RULES.

No registry, signpost, or code conflict may be implicitly resolved by
precedence alone.

Specifically:

- Precedence rules define WHICH rule would apply
- They do NOT authorize implicit resolution

If a conflict exists between any governed rules, procedures, or constraints:

1. The conflict MUST be explicitly identified and reported
2. The AI MUST STOP unless explicitly instructed how to proceed
3. Precedence MUST NOT be applied silently or implicitly

Failure to report a detected conflict before resolution constitutes
a governance violation.

----------------------------------------
F) POLICY-B CONFLICT RESOLUTION (GOVERNED SURFACE AREA)
----------------------------------------
SEQUENCING REQUIREMENT:

This section MUST NOT be consulted unless:
1. A conflict has been explicitly identified
2. STOP conditions in Section E have been triggered
3. Explicit user instruction authorizing resolution has been received

Violation of this sequence constitutes a governance breach.

This section applies ONLY after all conflict-handling requirements in:

- E) INTERACTION WITH GOVERNANCE COMPENDIUM (MANDATORY)

have been satisfied.

Scope:
This rule applies exclusively to Policy-B governed surface area, defined as:

- Entrypoints
- Timers (SetTimer callbacks)
- OnMessage / IPC handlers
- IPC sender contracts and encodings
- Settings IO and defaults interface
- Lifecycle and process controls

Rules:

PB-1. If a conflict exists involving Policy-B governed surface area, the conflict
      MUST first be explicitly identified, reported, and gated by STOP
      as required by Section E.

PB-2. Once explicit conflict reporting has occurred and the user has
      explicitly authorized resolution, GLOBAL_REGISTRY_MASTER.csv
      is the authoritative source of truth.

PB-3. No Policy-B conflict may be resolved by:
      - inference
      - heuristic reasoning
      - code inspection alone
      - precedence shortcuts
      - assumed registry intent

PB-4. If GLOBAL_REGISTRY_MASTER.csv is missing, unreadable, or ambiguous
      with respect to the conflicted surface area, the AI MUST STOP.

PB-5. Resolution authority for Policy-B conflicts is NEVER implicit.
      Explicit user instruction is mandatory.

END POLICY-B CONFLICT RESOLUTION

; ------------------------------------------------------------------
0. Permanence Reinforcement Rule
; ------------------------------------------------------------------

0a. At the start of every session, the AI must confirm it has read this file.

0b. Connector Availability Requirement Rule

0ba. If Google Drive access is unavailable, disconnected, expired, or fails at any point during a session, the AI must:
0baa. Explicitly state that Google Drive access is unavailable.
0bab. Stop immediately without analysis, suggestions, or assumptions.
0bac. Wait for the user to restore access.

----------------------------------------
0.5. TERMINOLOGY NORMALIZATION (MANDATORY)
----------------------------------------

In single-artifact mode:

- References to a "file" SHALL be interpreted as:
  - GOVERNANCE_COMPENDIUM.txt :: <SECTION ID>
    unless explicitly stated otherwise.

- Governance sections are treated as VIRTUAL FILES and are subject to:
  - full-read requirements
  - truncation detection
  - STOP semantics identical to physical files

- Physical file references are valid ONLY for:
  - runtime artifacts
  - registries explicitly declared as external
  - tooling-constrained formats (e.g., .json)

This rule applies globally unless explicitly overridden.

; ------------------------------------------------------------------
1. Blueprint Architecture Reference Rule
; ------------------------------------------------------------------

1a. Whenever a request involves:
1aa. File interactions
1ab. Module responsibilities
1ac. Includes or dependencies
1ad. Ownership of logic
1ae. Controller/worker boundaries

1b. The AI must:
1ba. Locate and read the current GOVERNANCE_COMPENDIUM.txt :: SECTION GOV.S3.BLUEPRINT from Google Drive.
1bb. The authoritative project structure is defined by:
  - GOVERNANCE_COMPENDIUM.txt :: SECTION GOV.S3.BLUEPRINT

This section is the sole structural authority.
No other section, registry, runtime artifact, or inference
may define, expand, or reduce project structure.

1bc. Reject any reasoning or suggestion that contradicts the blueprint.

1c. If the blueprint cannot be verified, the AI must stop.

; ------------------------------------------------------------------
2. Mandatory Re-Verification Rule
; ------------------------------------------------------------------

2a. For every response related to Pipz_Project_V3:

2aa. The AI must identify which project files are relevant to the user's request.
2ab. The AI must locate, open, and fully read the current .txt mirror of each relevant file from Google Drive within the same response cycle.
2ac. The AI must base its response only on the contents verified in that cycle, not on memory from prior messages.
2ad. If any relevant mirror file cannot be found, opened, or verified as current, the AI must stop and report the issue.

2b. Cached knowledge, prior conversation context, or previous reads may not be used as substitutes for verification.

; ------------------------------------------------------------------
2c. Content-Fingerprint Cache-Busting Rule
; ------------------------------------------------------------------

2ca. Every relevant .txt mirror must contain a Content-Fingerprint line in its MAINTEMPLATE header.

2cb. Content-Fingerprint format is defined as:
YYYY-MM-DDTHH-MM-SSZ-XXXXXXXX

Where:
; - The timestamp is in UTC.
; - The suffix is exactly 8 characters.
; - Valid suffix characters are uppercase A–Z and digits 0–9.

2cc. For each relevant .txt mirror read in a response cycle, the AI must locate and extract the Content-Fingerprint value.

2cd. The AI must treat any previously-read copy of that file as stale if its Content-Fingerprint differs from the value extracted in the current cycle.

2ce. If the user supplies a Content-Fingerprint (full or suffix-only) for a file, the AI must verify that the current .txt mirror's Content-Fingerprint matches before reasoning or proposing changes.

2cf. If a relevant .txt mirror lacks a Content-Fingerprint line, the AI must stop and report the missing fingerprint.

; ------------------------------------------------------------------
2d. Response Fingerprint Declaration Rule
; ------------------------------------------------------------------

2da. For any response that includes analysis, suggestions, refactors, debugging, or proposed changes related to Pipz_Project_V3, the AI must declare the Content-Fingerprint value(s) it used.

2db. This declaration must appear at the very top of the response, before any analysis or content, in the following format:

Fingerprint Used: <Content-Fingerprint>

2dc. If multiple files are involved, the AI must list each file and its corresponding Content-Fingerprint.

2dd. If the AI cannot confidently declare the Content-Fingerprint used, it must stop and report the verification failure instead of responding.

; ------------------------------------------------------------------
2e. Fingerprint Challenge Mode (FCM) Rule
; ------------------------------------------------------------------

2ea. If the very first line of the user's message begins with the exact prefix "FCM-", the AI must treat the request as a Fingerprint Challenge Mode (FCM) request.

2eb. FCM line format (STRICT):

FCM-<FINGERPRINT>-<FILENAME>

2ebc. <FINGERPRINT> may be provided in one of two allowed formats:

2ebca. Full fingerprint format:
YYYY-MM-DDTHH-MM-SSZ-XXXXXXXX

2ebcb. Suffix-only fingerprint format:
XXXXXXXX

Where:
; - XXXXXXXX is the final 8 characters of the Content-Fingerprint.
; - Valid characters are uppercase A–Z and digits 0–9.

2ebd. The AI must determine which fingerprint format was provided based on structure and length, not by assumption.

2ebe. If a full fingerprint is provided, the AI must compare the entire Content-Fingerprint value for an exact match.

2ebf. If a suffix-only fingerprint is provided, the AI must compare only the final 8 characters of the Content-Fingerprint, but must still extract and later declare the full Content-Fingerprint value used.

2ec. Multiple FCM lines may be provided, one per file, and must appear as consecutive lines at the very top of the user's message before any other content.

2ed. For each FCM line, the AI must:
2eda. Locate, open, and fully read the corresponding .txt mirror from Google Drive.
2edb. Extract the full Content-Fingerprint value.
2edc. Perform the comparison required by Rule 2ebe or 2ebf.

2ee. If any comparison fails, the AI must stop and respond with:
2eea. An explicit statement that the fingerprint did not match.
2eeb. The expected fingerprint or suffix provided by the user.
2eec. The full Content-Fingerprint value found in the mirror.

2eef. While any FCM mismatch exists, the AI must not provide analysis, suggestions, refactors, debugging, or proposed changes.

2ef. If all FCM checks pass, the AI may proceed, but must still comply with Rule 2d by declaring the full Content-Fingerprint value(s) used at the top of its response.

; ------------------------------------------------------------------
2f. Drive Folder / File ID Acceleration Rule (NON-SUBSTITUTIVE)
; ------------------------------------------------------------------

2fa. If the user provides explicit Google Drive folder IDs or file IDs, the AI is permitted to use them to enumerate contents directly.

2fb. Provided IDs may be used to:
2fba. Resolve the project root directory.
2fbb. Enumerate full directory trees, including non-text assets.
2fbc. Locate files that are not discoverable via content search.

2fc. Drive IDs are an acceleration mechanism only and MUST NOT replace:
2fca. Targeted search requirements.
2fcb. GEMINI MEM TAG path verification.
2fcc. Content-Fingerprint verification.
2fcd. Registry and blueprint verification.

2fd. If Drive ID enumeration results conflict with search results, declared paths, or fingerprints:
2fda. The AI must stop.
2fdb. Report the discrepancy.
2fdc. Wait for explicit user instruction.

2fe. Absence of provided Drive IDs MUST NOT be treated as an error or failure condition.

; ------------------------------------------------------------------
2g. Drive ID vs Verification Precedence Rule (AMBIGUITY RESOLUTION)
; ------------------------------------------------------------------

2ga. Google Drive folder and file IDs (including VERIFIED status) provide deterministic location only and do not establish content truth, freshness, or correctness.
2gb. The precedence order is STRICT:
2gba. AI_PROJECT_INSTRUCTIONS governance rules.
2gbb. Content-Fingerprint verification (cache-busting rules).
2gbc. GEMINI MEM TAG declared path identity.
2gbd. Blueprint-defined structure and responsibility.
2gbe. Drive IDs, folder listings, and search results.

2gc. If Drive IDs conflict with declared paths, fingerprints, or blueprint structure:
2gca. The AI must stop immediately.
2gcb. Report expected vs observed values.
2gcc. Wait for explicit user instruction.

2gd. If tooling limitations (including truncation, partial reads, or access restrictions) prevent a verifiable full read of any required governance file, relevant mirror file, or required registry tab:
2gda. The AI must stop and explicitly report the limitation.
2gdb. The AI must not infer, assume, summarize, or fabricate missing content under any circumstances, even if Drive IDs are VERIFIED.

2ge. If folder listing is unavailable or incomplete:
2gea. The AI may fall back to search-only reconstruction using declared paths.
2geb. The fallback is valid only if all required verification rules (fingerprints, path identity, and required file reads) can still be satisfied.
2gec. If verification cannot be satisfied under fallback, the AI must stop.

; ------------------------------------------------------------------
2h. Project Learned Constraints Mandatory Consultation Rule (ABSOLUTE)
; ------------------------------------------------------------------

2ha. Before the AI may perform any analysis, reasoning, suggestion, refactor,
     debugging step, architectural proposal, or solution design related to
     Pipz_Project_V3, the AI MUST:

2haa. Locate, open, and fully read:
      ; - GOVERNANCE_COMPENDIUM.txt :: SECTION GOV.S8.LEARNED_CONSTRAINTS

2hab. Actively evaluate whether any existing constraint is relevant to the
      current task, file, subsystem, or approach under consideration.

2hb. The GOVERNANCE_COMPENDIUM.txt :: SECTION GOV.S8.LEARNED_CONSTRAINTS file is authoritative for negative
     knowledge.

2hc. Any approach, method, or pattern recorded as invalidated or constrained
     MUST NOT be repeated, suggested, or reintroduced unless the user explicitly
     authorizes re-evaluation.

2hd. If a relevant learned constraint exists:
2hda. The AI MUST acknowledge it internally before reasoning.
2hdb. The AI MUST NOT propose the constrained approach.
2hdc. The AI MUST adapt its reasoning accordingly or stop.

2he. During any session, if the AI discovers that:
2hea. A method it attempted failed,
2heb. A proposal it made was invalid,
2hec. A tooling or architectural assumption was proven incorrect,
2hed. Or an approach conflicts with project reality,

2hf. The AI MUST immediately draft a proposed entry for:
      ; - GOVERNANCE_COMPENDIUM.txt :: SECTION GOV.S8.LEARNED_CONSTRAINTS

2hg. Drafted constraint entries MUST:
2hga. Follow the Project Learned Constraints ID Policy.
2hgb. Clearly describe the invalidated approach.
2hgc. Be presented to the user explicitly for confirmation or rejection.

2hh. Failure to consult GOVERNANCE_COMPENDIUM.txt :: SECTION GOV.S8.LEARNED_CONSTRAINTS before reasoning, or
     failure to draft a newly discovered constraint, constitutes a violation
     of this instruction set and requires the AI to stop under Rule 3b.

; ------------------------------------------------------------------
2i. Implicit File Reference Resolution Rule (ABSOLUTE)
; ------------------------------------------------------------------

2ia. If the user references a project file by name or role (explicitly or
     implicitly), and that file is part of Pipz_Project_V3 governance,
     structure, or tooling, the AI MUST attempt deterministic resolution
     before claiming inability to read or locate the file.

2ib. Deterministic resolution MUST follow this order:
2iba. Consult GOVERNANCE_COMPENDIUM.txt :: SECTION GOV.S7.INDEX_ID_LIST for a matching file entry,
      including alias and role mappings defined therein.
2ibb. Use the associated Drive ID to locate and open the file.
2ibc. Verify the file identity using path declarations and fingerprints.

2ic. The AI MUST NOT state that it cannot locate, read, or verify a file
     if a valid Drive ID exists for that file in GOVERNANCE_COMPENDIUM.txt :: SECTION GOV.S7.INDEX_ID_LIST.

2id. Only if:
     ; - No matching entry exists in GOVERNANCE_COMPENDIUM.txt :: SECTION GOV.S7.INDEX_ID_LIST, AND
     ; - Path-based resolution fails, AND
     ; - Search fallback is exhausted per Rule 2g,
     may the AI report inability to locate the file.

2ie. Failure to consult GOVERNANCE_COMPENDIUM.txt :: SECTION GOV.S7.INDEX_ID_LIST when resolving an implicitly
     referenced file constitutes a violation of this instruction set
     and requires the AI to stop under Rule 3b.

; ------------------------------------------------------------------
2j. Response Status Header Rule (ABSOLUTE)
; ------------------------------------------------------------------

2ja. Any AI response that references, analyzes, reasons about, or proposes
     changes to any Pipz_Project_V3 file, structure, registry, blueprint,
     indexing, or governance artifact MUST include exactly one of the
     following status headers:

STATUS — LIVE
STATUS — HISTORICAL

2jb. STATUS — LIVE may be used ONLY if, in the current response cycle, the AI has:
2jba. Completed all required Bootstrap gating for the session when applicable.
2jbb. Complied with Rule 2 (Mandatory Re-Verification) for all relevant files.
2jbc. Complied with Rule 2h (PROJECT_LEARNED_CONSTRAINTS consultation).
2jbd. Complied with Rule 2i (deterministic resolution using INDEXIDLIST, including aliases).

2jc. STATUS — HISTORICAL MUST be used if any condition required by Rule 2jb
     cannot be satisfied in the current response cycle.

2jd. HISTORICAL RESPONSE LIMITATION (ABSOLUTE):
2jda. A STATUS — HISTORICAL response MUST contain explanation and remediation only.
2jdb. A STATUS — HISTORICAL response MUST NOT contain substantive analysis,
      reasoning, design proposals, refactors, debugging steps, or code changes.
2jdc. A STATUS — HISTORICAL response MUST comply with Rule 3b:
      ; - Cite the blocking rule(s)
      ; - Explain why compliance is not possible
      ; - Propose 1–3 resolution paths
      ; - Wait for explicit user instruction

2je. ORDERING RULE (STRICT):
2jea. If Rule 16 initial confirmation applies, the first non-empty line MUST be:
      ANYSKIPPERS
2jeb. If Rule 16 initial confirmation applies, the STATUS header MUST appear as
      the next non-empty line immediately after ANYSKIPPERS.
2jec. Otherwise, the STATUS header MUST be the first non-empty line of the response.

2jf. LIVE + FINGERPRINT ORDERING (STRICT):
2jfa. If STATUS — LIVE is used and the response contains analysis/suggestions/
      refactors/debugging/proposed changes, the response MUST also comply with Rule 2d
      by declaring Fingerprint Used immediately after the STATUS header.

2jg. Failure to include the required STATUS header, or misuse of STATUS — LIVE,
     constitutes a violation of this instruction set and requires STOP under Rule 3b.

; ------------------------------------------------------------------
2k. Pre-Transmission Sanity Audit (MANDATORY EXIT-GATE)
; ------------------------------------------------------------------
2ka. Prior to completing any response, the AI MUST perform a silent internal 
     audit of the proposed content against all required governance sections of GOVERNANCE_COMPENDIUM.txt.
2kb. VERIFICATION CRITERIA:
     - Is there a Version Header from GOVERNANCE_COMPENDIUM.txt :: SECTION GOV.S9.STANDARD_HEADERS?
     - Is the content a 1:1 literal match (no summarization)?
     - Does the logic violate any PLC (e.g., PLC-0005 or PLC-0006)?
     - Are all registry updates formatted in raw tab-separated style?
2kc. If any violation is detected, the AI must discard the drafted response 
     and regenerate a compliant version.
2kd. Failure to perform this audit or outputting non-compliant content 
     constitutes a "Hard-Stop" breach under Rule 3b.

; ------------------------------------------------------------------
3. Scope of Authority Rule
; ------------------------------------------------------------------

3a. These rules govern all AI involvement in Pipz_Project_V3, including:

3aa. Analysis
3ab. Suggestions
3ac. Refactors
3ad. New features
3ae. Audits
3af. Debugging
3ag. Documentation updates

3b. If any rule in this document cannot be followed, the AI must stop and report why.

3ba. The AI must explicitly state which rule(s) cannot be followed.
3bb. The AI must explain why the rule(s) cannot be satisfied in the current situation.
3bc. The AI must propose at least one viable resolution path.
3bd. When possible, the AI must propose two to three alternative resolution paths.
3be. The AI must wait for explicit user instruction before proceeding.
3bf. This requirement applies to all STOP conditions defined elsewhere in this document.
3bg. This includes, but is not limited to, failure to comply with Rule 2h
     (Project Learned Constraints Mandatory Consultation Rule).
3bh. This includes, but is not limited to, failure to comply with Rule 2j
     (Response Status Header Rule).

3c. Project Learned Constraints ID Policy (ABSOLUTE)

3ca. All entries in GOVERNANCE_COMPENDIUM.txt :: SECTION GOV.S8.LEARNED_CONSTRAINTS must be identified
     by a stable, monotonically increasing ID using the format:

     PLC-XXXX

Where: 
;- XXXX is a zero-padded decimal number.

3cb. IDs are assigned strictly in order of discovery and must never be:

3cba. Reused
3cbb. Renumbered
3cbc. Reordered
3cbd. Repurposed to encode semantic meaning

3cc. Gaps in numbering are permitted and must not be filled.

3cd. The ID itself is an opaque identifier; all meaning must be expressed
     in the entry title and body, not in the ID.

3ce. Any reference to a learned constraint in governance, audits, reasoning,
     or regression prevention must reference the constraint by its PLC ID.

3cf. Deleting or modifying an existing PLC entry does not permit reassignment
     of its ID.

; ------------------------------------------------------------------
3d. Proactive Constraint Capture Mandate (THE "EMISSION" RULE)
; ------------------------------------------------------------------

3da. Upon identifying a "Learned Constraint" (defined as any discovery that 
     invalidates a previous approach, reveals a platform/tooling limitation, 
     or identifies a non-obvious failure mode), the AI MUST immediately 
     stop and draft a new entry for GOVERNANCE_COMPENDIUM.txt :: SECTION GOV.S8.LEARNED_CONSTRAINTS.

3db. The AI is FORBIDDEN from attempting to "fix" the issue in code or 
     structural files until the PLC entry has been formally proposed and 
     accepted into the project context.

3dc. The draft MUST follow the MAINTEMPLATE format and adhere to the 
     ID Policy defined in Rule 3c.

3dd. Proceeding before documenting a known regression in the 
     PLC constitutes a Governance Breach under Rule 3b.

; ------------------------------------------------------------------
4. Version Header Enforcement Rule (ABSOLUTE)
; ------------------------------------------------------------------

4a. The AI must NEVER modify, suggest modifying, or generate modified code unless the file contains a valid version header and that header is updated as part of the change.

4b. Required header format (STRICT):

; ------------------------------------------------------------------
; MAINTEMPLATE - FILENAME (AHK v2)
; Version: x.x.x (SEMANTIC VERSIONING)
; Last change: BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE MOST RECENT CHANGES.
; ------------------------------------------------------------------

4c. Enforcement rules:

4ca. Semantic versioning is mandatory:
4caa. MAJOR → breaking changes
4cab. MINOR → new behavior / features
4cac. PATCH → fixes, refactors, non-breaking changes

4cb. Exactly one "Last change" line.
4cc. If the header is missing, outdated, malformed, or not updated, the AI must refuse the change.

; ------------------------------------------------------------------
4d. Cross-Language Header Comment Prefix Compatibility Rule (ABSOLUTE)
; ------------------------------------------------------------------

4da. The required MAINTEMPLATE header fields and semantics (Version, Last change, Content-Fingerprint) apply to ALL governed-readable files, not only .ahk.

4db. The comment prefix used for the MAINTEMPLATE header and related governance lines MUST match the file’s language:

4dba. ';'  → .ahk, .ini, and governed .txt documents
4dbb. '//' → .js and .ts
4dbc. '#'  → .py, .yml, and .yaml

4dc. JSON files (.json) MUST NOT include commented headers (JSON does not support comments). For governed JSON, a sidecar governance file MUST be used:

4dca. <file>.json (pure JSON)
4dcb. <file>.json.governance.txt (governed header + identity + fingerprint)

4dd. If the correct comment prefix cannot be used (e.g., due to parser or tooling constraints), the AI MUST STOP under Rule 3b and propose a compliant alternative.

; ------------------------------------------------------------------
5. Drive Mirror Rule (PRIMARY READ SOURCE)
; ------------------------------------------------------------------

5a. The AI must treat .txt mirrors in Google Drive as the authoritative readable source.

5aa. Drive-backed artifacts define PHYSICAL REALITY only.
5ab. Authoritative governance semantics are derived exclusively from:
     - GOVERNANCE_COMPENDIUM.txt sections (virtual files)
5ac. Drive visibility does not confer governance authority.
5ad. Unreadable or truncated governance sections MUST trigger STOP,
     regardless of Drive availability or file existence.
5ae. Partial visibility, truncation, or section-level unreadability of
     GOVERNANCE_COMPENDIUM.txt or any required Section ID
     SHALL be treated as UNREADABLE per GOV.S0.COMPENDIUM_META IR-5
     and MUST trigger an immediate STOP.

5b. Rules:
5ba. .txt files are used for reading, analysis, verification, and reasoning.
5bb. .ahk / .ini files are treated as runtime artifacts only.
5bc. If a .txt mirror and a runtime file disagree, the .txt mirror wins.

5c. The AI must never assume parity and must verify.

; ------------------------------------------------------------------
6. Path Identity Requirement Rule
; ------------------------------------------------------------------

6a. Every file the AI reads or modifies must be identified by its declared path, not by inference.

6b. Mandatory check:
6ba. Each .txt mirror must contain a path declaration:

; GEMINI MEM TAG
; MY FULL PATH IS "Pipz_Project_V3\<relative\path>"

6c. Rules:
6ca. The AI must confirm this tag before reasoning about file location.
6cb. Path reconstruction must use this tag, never assumptions.
6cc. If the tag is missing or ambiguous, the AI must stop.

6cd. The GEMINI MEM TAG and path declaration lines MUST be commented using the file’s correct comment prefix as defined in Rule 4d (e.g., '//' for .js/.ts, '#' for .py/.yaml). The semantic text must remain identical.

6ce. The AI MUST NOT reject an otherwise valid GEMINI MEM TAG solely because the comment prefix differs from ';' when the file type requires a different prefix.

; ------------------------------------------------------------------
7. Registry Supremacy Rule
; ------------------------------------------------------------------

7a. The Registry Authority is defined by the following hierarchy:
7aa. PRIMARY: GLOBAL_REGISTRY_MASTER.csv (Authoritative governed registry, Policy-B)
7ab. SECONDARY: GLOBAL_REGISTRY_MASTER.gsheet (Backup Vault ONLY — may be unreadable to tooling)
7ac. NON-GOVERNED INDEX: INTERNAL_FUNCTION_INDEX.csv (Informational, regenerable; not a hard-stop)

7b. GLOBAL_REGISTRY_MASTER.csv is the single source of truth for Policy-B governance surface area:
7ba. Entrypoints (startup / handlers)
7bb. Timers (SetTimer callbacks)
7bc. IPC send/receive contracts (OnMessage/WM_* where applicable)
7bd. Settings IO + Defaults interface
7be. Lifecycle / process controls
7bf. Logic invariants tied to the governed surface area

7c. AI obligations (Policy-B aligned):
7ca. The AI MUST consult GLOBAL_REGISTRY_MASTER.csv before writing code that affects governed surface area.
7cb. The AI MUST NOT introduce, remove, or rename any governed surface entrypoint/timer/IPC/lifecycle/settings interface without a corresponding registry update plan.
7cc. Internal helpers are permitted to exist outside the governed registry and must NOT force registry churn.
7cd. INTERNAL_FUNCTION_INDEX.csv may be used to locate internal helpers, but it is informational and may drift.
7ce. If code conflicts with GLOBAL_REGISTRY_MASTER.csv on governed surface ownership or invariants:
7cea. The AI must flag the conflict.
7ceb. Propose reconciliation.
7cec. Wait for confirmation before proceeding.

; ------------------------------------------------------------------
8. Blueprint Synchronization Rule
; ------------------------------------------------------------------

8a. Any AI-suggested or AI-generated change that affects:
8aa. Structure
8ab. Ownership
8ac. Architecture
8ad. Responsibility

8b. Must be reflected in:
8ba. Code
8bb. .txt mirror
8bc. GOVERNANCE_COMPENDIUM.txt :: SECTION GOV.S3.BLUEPRINT (and GOVERNANCE_COMPENDIUM.txt :: SECTION GOV.S4.ANCHOR_MASTER when applicable)

8c. If synchronization is incomplete, the change is invalid.

; ------------------------------------------------------------------
9. Verification-Before-Action Rule
; ------------------------------------------------------------------

9a. Before the AI may:
9aa. Refactor
9ab. Optimize
9ac. Extend functionality
9ad. Move code
9ae. Rename symbols

9b. It must first:
9ba. Locate the file via Drive.
9bb. Open and read its full contents.
9bc. Confirm registry alignment.
9bd. Confirm blueprint alignment.

9c. Skipping any step is prohibited.

; ------------------------------------------------------------------
10. No Assumptions / No Hallucination Rule
; ------------------------------------------------------------------

10a. The AI must never:
10aa. Assume a file exists
10ab. Assume a function exists
10ac. Assume a variable is global
10ad. Infer structure from memory

10b. If a file or symbol cannot be found via Drive or Registry:
10ba. It does not exist.
10bb. The AI must stop and report the gap.

; ------------------------------------------------------------------
11. Change Granularity Rule
; ------------------------------------------------------------------

11a. One logical change per action.

11b. No bundled edits.

11c. No opportunistic refactors.

11d. Each change must satisfy all of the following:
11da. Be explainable in one sentence.
11db. Map cleanly to one version bump.

; ------------------------------------------------------------------
12. Stop-On-Conflict Rule
; ------------------------------------------------------------------

12a. If the AI detects:
12aa. Registry mismatch
12ab. Mirror mismatch
12ac. Blueprint mismatch
12ad. Missing file
12ae. Ambiguous ownership

12b. It must:
12ba. Stop immediately.
12bb. Describe the conflict.
12bc. Propose resolution paths.
12bd. Wait for explicit instruction.

12c. No auto-resolution is allowed.

; ------------------------------------------------------------------
13. Drive Is Ground Truth Rule
; ------------------------------------------------------------------

13a. For the AI:
13aa. The file hierarchy defined in Rule 7 (GSheet > CSV) and the 
     structural mirrors in GOVERNANCE_COMPENDIUM.txt :: SECTION GOV.S3.BLUEPRINT define reality.
13ab. Local state is irrelevant.
13ac. Past conversation memory is advisory only.

13b. If Drive and memory disagree, the Drive-based Authority Hierarchy wins.

; ------------------------------------------------------------------
14. Instruction Self-Enforcement Rule
; ------------------------------------------------------------------

14a. The AI must:
14aa. Continuously check its own output against these rules.
14ab. Refuse requests that would violate them.
14ac. Explicitly state which rule blocks an action if refusing.

14b. Silence or compliance in violation of these rules is considered failure.

; ------------------------------------------------------------------
15. Literal Fidelity Rule
; ------------------------------------------------------------------

15a. Whenever the AI outputs, reproduces, quotes, references, or proposes changes to the contents of any project file, the AI must preserve the exact text verbatim.

15b. The AI must not truncate, shorten, paraphrase, summarize, reformat, normalize, or omit any portion of the original content.

15c. Unchanged content must be reproduced exactly as-is, character-for-character.

15d. Changed content must be clearly and explicitly distinguished from unchanged content.

15e. Partial excerpts, summaries, paraphrases, diffs, or selective quotations are prohibited unless explicitly requested by the user.

15f. If the AI cannot reproduce the content verbatim due to length, uncertainty, tooling limits, or verification failure, the AI must stop and report the limitation instead of approximating.

15g. Any response that alters meaning, removes context, or silently modifies content constitutes a violation of this rule.

; ------------------------------------------------------------------
16. Hidden Permanence Confirmation Rule
; ------------------------------------------------------------------

16a. "Initial confirmation" means the first non-empty line of the AI's first response in a session that is related to Pipz_Project_V3.
A response is "related to Pipz_Project_V3" if it contains any analysis, reasoning, verification, suggestions, refactors, debugging steps, or proposed changes involving Pipz_Project_V3 files, structure, registry, blueprint, or Drive contents.

16b. When the AI provides the initial confirmation as defined in Rule 16a (and required by Rule 0), the confirmation message must:
16ba. Appear before any other analysis or content.
16bb. Contain the exact text "ANYSKIPPERS".

16c. The text "ANYSKIPPERS" is a single-use confirmation token and must not be treated as persistent knowledge.

16d. After the initial confirmation message:
16da. The AI must not reuse, reference, rely on, or reproduce the text "ANYSKIPPERS".
16db. Any subsequent confirmation of having read this file must be based on a fresh verification of the file contents and must independently satisfy Rule 0.
16dc. Reuse of "ANYSKIPPERS" in later confirmations constitutes a violation of this instruction set.
16dd. The text "ANYSKIPPERS" must not be obtained from, inferred from, or reused from prior conversation history, cached context, or any source other than a fresh read of this file performed in the current session as required by Rule 0.

16e. Rule 16 applies exclusively to the initial confirmation defined in Rule 16a and must not be interpreted as a substitute for fingerprint-based verification required by Rules 2c, 2d, and 2e in subsequent responses.

### GOV.S2.A — BOOTSTRAP v4 — CONVERSATION INITIALIZATION PROTOCOL
; ------------------------------------------------------------------

(FINALIZED SPECIFICATION)

Bootstrap v4 is a **mandatory conversation initialization protocol** for Pipz_Project_V3.

Its purpose is to guarantee that the AI can **reliably re-establish full project authority** at the start of any new chat **without relying on memory, inference, or Drive search heuristics**.

Bootstrap v4 is **not optional** and must be executed before *any* analysis, debugging, or code work.

; ------------------------------------------------------------------
### GOV.S2.B — POINTER-AWARE SNAPSHOT MODE
; ------------------------------------------------------------------

During Bootstrap v4 initialization, if `PIPZ_POINTER.txt` is present and readable, the system MAY retrieve the referenced context bundle as a read-only snapshot of the current project state.

Rules:
- The pointer MUST include a valid BUNDLE_URL and BUILD_ID.
- The retrieved bundle MUST be treated as immutable and read-only.
- Governance validation and enforcement MUST continue to bind exclusively to canonical artifacts.
- Absence of the pointer MUST NOT block bootstrap.

If the pointer is present but unreadable, stale, or internally inconsistent → STOP and surface a tooling fault.

; ------------------------------------------------------------------
PHASE 0 — GOVERNANCE GATE (HARD STOP)
; ------------------------------------------------------------------

The AI **MUST**:

1. Locate, open, and fully read:

   ; - `GOVERNANCE_COMPENDIUM.txt :: SECTION GOV.S1.AI_INSTRUCTIONS`

2. Verify:

   ; - Presence of GEMINI MEM TAG
   ; - Presence of Content-Fingerprint
   ; - Fingerprint is well-formed and readable

3. Obey **all rules** defined within, including but not limited to:

   ; - Mandatory re-verification rules
   ; - Fingerprint precedence rules
   ; - Stop-on-conflict rules
   ; - ANYSKIPPERS single-use confirmation requirement

STOP CONDITIONS (ABSOLUTE):

; - File cannot be opened
; - File is truncated
; - Fingerprint is missing or malformed
; - Any rule cannot be satisfied

No further phases may execute if Phase 0 fails.

; ------------------------------------------------------------------
PHASE 1 — ROOT RESOLUTION (NO SEARCH HEURISTICS)
; ------------------------------------------------------------------

Bootstrap v4 **does not rely on Google Drive search alone**.

Root resolution uses the following **strict precedence order**:

1. `GOVERNANCE_COMPENDIUM.txt :: SECTION GOV.S7.INDEX_ID_LIST` (if present)

   ; - Canonical Drive folder ID for `\Pipz_Project_V3`
   ; - Declared as acceleration only, never truth

2. GEMINI MEM TAG declared paths

3. `GOVERNANCE_COMPENDIUM.txt :: SECTION GOV.S3.BLUEPRINT` defined structure

4. Google Drive search (LAST RESORT ONLY)

RULE:

Drive IDs accelerate access but do not establish authority.

If root cannot be resolved deterministically → **STOP**.

; ------------------------------------------------------------------
PHASE 2 — CANONICAL FILE SET VERIFICATION
; ------------------------------------------------------------------

The AI **MUST** locate, open, and fully read the following mandatory files:
; - GOVERNANCE_COMPENDIUM.txt :: SECTION GOV.S1.AI_INSTRUCTIONS
; - GOVERNANCE_COMPENDIUM.txt :: SECTION GOV.S3.BLUEPRINT
; - GOVERNANCE_COMPENDIUM.txt :: SECTION GOV.S4.ANCHOR_MASTER
; - GOVERNANCE_COMPENDIUM.txt :: SECTION GOV.S7.INDEX_ID_LIST
; - GOVERNANCE_COMPENDIUM.txt :: SECTION GOV.S8.LEARNED_CONSTRAINTS

The AI **MUST** ALSO locate and read the MASTER REGISTRY (Policy-B):
; - PRIMARY: GLOBAL_REGISTRY_MASTER.csv (Authoritative governed registry, Policy-B)
; - SECONDARY: GLOBAL_REGISTRY_MASTER.gsheet (Backup Vault ONLY — may be inaccessible to tooling)

Each file must:
; - Be readable in full
; - Declare Content-Fingerprint (where applicable)
; - Match its declared identity
; - Adhere to the PLC-0006 "Flat-File Sovereignty" constraint

STOP CONDITIONS:
; - Any of the mandatory governance sections of GOVERNANCE_COMPENDIUM.txt are missing.
; - GLOBAL_REGISTRY_MASTER.csv is missing or unreadable.
; - The registry cannot be verified as Policy-B scoped.

; ------------------------------------------------------------------
PHASE 3 — STRUCTURE RECONSTRUCTION (EXPECTED STATE)
; ------------------------------------------------------------------

Using **only authoritative declarations**, the AI reconstructs the **expected project structure**, including:

; - Root directory
; - Governance directory
; - Registry directory
; - Controller / Worker / Lib / Modules directories
; - Required `.txt` mirrors
; - Required runtime counterparts

This phase establishes **what must exist**, not what Drive happens to expose.
No inference is permitted.

; ------------------------------------------------------------------
PHASE 4 — VERIFICATION DECLARATION
; ------------------------------------------------------------------

Only after Phases 0–3 succeed may the AI:

; - Declare successful Bootstrap v4 completion
; - Proceed with analysis, debugging, or code work

All subsequent responses must continue to obey:

; - Mandatory fingerprint declarations
; - Stop-on-conflict behavior
; - No assumption / no inference rules

; ------------------------------------------------------------------
BOOTSTRAP v4 — COMPLETION DECLARATION (CANONICAL)
; ------------------------------------------------------------------

If and only if Phases 0 through 4 complete successfully, the AI MUST emit
the following declaration verbatim in its response:

"BOOTSTRAP v4 COMPLETE — Pipz_Project_V3 authority established."

Rules:

1. The declaration MUST:

   ; - Appear as a standalone line
   ; - Appear before any analysis, reasoning, or suggestions
   ; - Appear only after successful completion of Phases 0–4

2. The declaration MUST NOT:

   ; - Be paraphrased
   ; - Be abbreviated
   ; - Be combined with other text
   ; - Be emitted conditionally or speculatively

3. If any phase fails:

   ; - The declaration MUST NOT be emitted
   ; - The AI MUST stop and report the failure point

4. This declaration:

   ; - Does NOT bypass fingerprint verification
   ; - Does NOT bypass registry checks
   ; - Does NOT authorize Phase 5 implicitly

This declaration signals initialization success only.
All subsequent rules remain in force.

; ------------------------------------------------------------------

================================================================================
BOOTSTRAP v4 — SINGLE-ARTIFACT MODE ADDENDUM
APPLIES WHEN: GOVERNANCE_COMPENDIUM.txt IS PRESENT AND AUTHORITATIVE
================================================================================

This addendum defines how Bootstrap v4 operates when Pipz_Project_V3 governance
is consolidated into GOVERNANCE_COMPENDIUM.txt under single-artifact mode.

This addendum is ADDITIVE and does not replace or modify the canonical Bootstrap
v4 phase definitions. All existing Bootstrap v4 rules remain in force unless
explicitly overridden here.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
A. AUTHORITY REBINDING (MANDATORY)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

When GOVERNANCE_COMPENDIUM.txt is present and declared authoritative:

- GOVERNANCE_COMPENDIUM.txt becomes the sole bootstrap governance container.
- All prior standalone governance files (now represented as sections) are treated as ARCHIVED ORIGINALS only.
- Bootstrap v4 MUST resolve governance artifacts via Section IDs, not filenames.

Canonical Bootstrap authority is now:

- GOVERNANCE_COMPENDIUM.txt :: SECTION GOV.S2.BOOTSTRAP_V4

If this section cannot be located or fully read, Bootstrap v4 MUST STOP.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
B. PHASE 0 — COMPENDIUM GATE (ADDITIVE)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Phase 0 MUST additionally verify:

[ ] GOVERNANCE_COMPENDIUM.txt is readable in full
[ ] Compendium MAINTEMPLATE header is present
[ ] Content-Fingerprint is present and well-formed
[ ] Required governance sections are not truncated:
    - GOV.S1.AI_INSTRUCTIONS
    - GOV.S2.BOOTSTRAP_V4
    - GOV.S3.BLUEPRINT
    - GOV.S7.INDEX_ID_LIST

If ANY required section is unreadable or truncated → STOP.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
C. FILE RESOLUTION OVERRIDE (MANDATORY)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

All Bootstrap references to governance files are rebound as follows:

- AI_PROJECT_INSTRUCTIONS.txt
  → GOVERNANCE_COMPENDIUM.txt :: SECTION GOV.S1.AI_INSTRUCTIONS

- BOOTSTRAPv4.txt
  → GOVERNANCE_COMPENDIUM.txt :: SECTION GOV.S2.BOOTSTRAP_V4

- _PROJECT_BLUEPRINT.txt
  → GOVERNANCE_COMPENDIUM.txt :: SECTION GOV.S3.BLUEPRINT

- _PROJECT_ANCHOR_MASTER.txt
  → GOVERNANCE_COMPENDIUM.txt :: SECTION GOV.S4.ANCHOR_MASTER

- PHASE5_AUDIT_MASTER.txt
  → GOVERNANCE_COMPENDIUM.txt :: SECTION GOV.S5.PHASE5_AUDIT

- INDEXIDLIST.txt
  → GOVERNANCE_COMPENDIUM.txt :: SECTION GOV.S7.INDEX_ID_LIST

Legacy file paths MUST NOT be consulted when compendium mode is active.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
D. STOP CONDITION REINFORCEMENT
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Bootstrap v4 MUST STOP if:

- GOVERNANCE_COMPENDIUM.txt is unreadable
- Any required Section ID cannot be located
- Any required section is partially visible or truncated
- Section ID conflicts with Compendium Meta (GOV.S0)
- Archived Original content is mistakenly used for enforcement

Partial visibility SHALL be treated as total absence.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
E. DECLARATION INTEGRITY
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The declaration:

"BOOTSTRAP v4 COMPLETE — Pipz_Project_V3 authority established."

is VALID ONLY IF:

- GOVERNANCE_COMPENDIUM.txt was read in full
- GOVERNANCE_COMPENDIUM.txt :: SECTION GOV.S2.BOOTSTRAP_V4 was read in full
- All Phase 0–4 requirements were satisfied under compendium rules

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### GOV.S3.A — MASTER BLUEPRINT: FOLDER ARCHITECTURE (MUST BE MAINTAINED)
; ------------------------------------------------------------------

AUTHORITATIVE ROLE DECLARATION (PHASE 5)

This section constitutes the sole authoritative Expected Set definition used during Phase 5 reconciliation.
All Expected items for Phase 5 MUST be derived exclusively from this section.
No other file, index, registry, or Drive enumeration source may define, expand, or reduce the Expected Set.

GOVERNANCE_COMPENDIUM.txt :: SECTION GOV.S7.INDEX_ID_LIST provides acceleration only.
GOVERNANCE_COMPENDIUM.txt :: SECTION GOV.S4.ANCHOR_MASTER provides intent, identity rules, architectural rationale and constraints only.
Discovered Drive contents provide Observed Set data only.

GOVERNANCE STRUCTURE NOTE (SINGLE-ARTIFACT MODE)

All authoritative governance content is consolidated into:

  - GOVERNANCE_COMPENDIUM.txt

Non-authoritative canonical support artifacts MAY exist outside the compendium
to preserve scalability, audit clarity, and long-form context, but MUST defer
to compendium-defined authority, rules, and precedence.

Such artifacts:
  - MUST be explicitly listed in this Blueprint
  - MUST NOT introduce governance authority
  - MUST NOT redefine structure, enforcement, or bootstrap behavior

Historical governance sources have been archived under:
  - \Archive\ (non-authoritative, non-operative)

Index coverage does not imply expected existence.
Expected existence is defined exclusively by this Blueprint section.

Virtual Section Semantics (MANDATORY):

Sections addressed using the form:
  GOVERNANCE_COMPENDIUM.txt :: SECTION <SECTION_ID>

are treated as virtual governance artifacts for the purposes of:
  - verification
  - readability checks
  - STOP enforcement
  - audit determinism

Failure to fully read a required section is equivalent to failure
to read a standalone governance file.

This section defines architectural structure ONLY.

Structural authority includes:
  - required directories
  - required files
  - required virtual governance sections
  - their canonical relationships

Structural authority explicitly excludes:
  - runtime behavior
  - logic flow
  - enforcement rules
  - registry semantics

The Archive directory MUST NOT be used for governance reasoning,
verification, or enforcement, Including for historical comparison unless explicitly instructed.

; ------------------------------------------------------------------
### GOV.S3.B — PROJECT SNAPSHOT TRANSPORT (PUBLISHER MODEL)
; ------------------------------------------------------------------

The project structure MAY be verified using either:
- Direct local filesystem enumeration, or
- A publisher-emitted context bundle referenced by `PIPZ_POINTER.txt`.

When using a bundle:
- The bundle BUILD_ID MUST match the BUILD_ID declared in the pointer.
- The bundle contents MUST reflect the active allowlist defined by the publisher configuration.
- Structural mismatches (missing directories, excluded authoritative files) MUST be treated as publish drift.

The snapshot transport mechanism does not define authority; it only transports state.

### GOV.S3.C — REGISTRY ACCESS & VERIFICATION PROTOCOL (CRITICAL)
; ------------------------------------------------------------------

To maintain a 1:1 literal match of the project state, the following protocol MUST be followed:

1. **REGISTRY LOCATION:** All Global State, Function, and Logic Rule data is stored externally in `GLOBAL_REGISTRY_MASTER.gsheet` (with `GLOBAL_REGISTRY_MASTER.csv` as the authoritative fallback mirror).

2. **BOOTSTRAP-ALIGNED INDEXING PROTOCOL:**
  ; - Project root resolution MUST follow Bootstrap v4 precedence rules.
  ; - `GOVERNANCE_COMPENDIUM.txt :: SECTION GOV.S7.INDEX_ID_LIST` MUST be used first when present to deterministically resolve the project root.
  ; - GEMINI MEM TAG path declarations are authoritative for identity and reconstruction.
  ; - Google Drive search is a LAST RESORT and must never override declared paths or fingerprints.

  ; - Once the root is resolved, enumerate and verify visibility of:
    ; - `\Controller`
    ; - `\Worker`
    ; - `\Lib`
    ; - `\Registry`
    ; - `\Governance`
    ; - `\Archive`
    ; - `\PPAVP`

  ; - Confirm visibility of required GOVERNANCE_COMPENDIUM virtual sections (Section IDs):
    ; - GOVERNANCE_COMPENDIUM.txt :: SECTION GOV.S1.AI_INSTRUCTIONS
    ; - GOVERNANCE_COMPENDIUM.txt :: SECTION GOV.S2.BOOTSTRAP_V4
    ; - GOVERNANCE_COMPENDIUM.txt :: SECTION GOV.S3.BLUEPRINT
    ; - GOVERNANCE_COMPENDIUM.txt :: SECTION GOV.S4.ANCHOR_MASTER
    ; - GOVERNANCE_COMPENDIUM.txt :: SECTION GOV.S5.PHASE5_AUDIT
    ; - GOVERNANCE_COMPENDIUM.txt :: SECTION GOV.S6.GOVERNANCE_LOCK
    ; - GOVERNANCE_COMPENDIUM.txt :: SECTION GOV.S7.INDEX_ID_LIST
    ; - GOVERNANCE_COMPENDIUM.txt :: SECTION GOV.S8.LEARNED_CONSTRAINTS
    ; - GOVERNANCE_COMPENDIUM.txt :: SECTION GOV.S9.STANDARD_HEADERS

  ; - Confirm visibility of required EXTERNAL REGISTRY ARTIFACTS (Policy-B):
    ; - GLOBAL_REGISTRY_MASTER.csv (PRIMARY — MUST be readable)
    ; - GLOBAL_REGISTRY_MASTER.gsheet (BACKUP VAULT — visibility only)

  ; - Visibility confirms existence and correct path resolution only.
  ; - Visibility does NOT imply readability, authority, or governance validity.
  ; - Runtime-only and non-readable assets (e.g. .png, .ahk, .ini, .key) are not subject to read or fingerprint verification.

  ; - External artifacts are not compendium sections and are governed by
      REGISTRY VERIFICATION PROTOCOL (Policy-B), not compendium truncation rules.
  ; - External registries are NOT virtual sections, are NOT part of
      GOVERNANCE_COMPENDIUM.txt, and are governed exclusively by
      Policy-B availability and readability rules.

3. **REGISTRY VERIFICATION PROTOCOL (POLICY-B SURFACE AREA):**
   ; - The AI MUST prioritize the PRIMARY readable registry source.
   ; - PRIMARY: `GLOBAL_REGISTRY_MASTER.csv` (Authoritative governed registry, Policy-B)
   ; - SECONDARY: `GLOBAL_REGISTRY_MASTER.gsheet` (Backup Vault ONLY — may be inaccessible to tooling)

   ; - Protocol:
     ; - Access `GLOBAL_REGISTRY_MASTER.csv` and verify it is readable in full.
     ; - Verify the registry is Policy-B scoped:
       ; - Contains only governance-critical surface area:
         ; - entrypoints (startup / GUI entrypoints where applicable)
         ; - timers (SetTimer callbacks)
         ; - OnMessage handlers / IPC receivers
         ; - IPC senders / contracts
         ; - settings IO + defaults interface
         ; - lifecycle / process controls
       ; - Internal helpers are NOT required to appear in this governed registry.

     ; - Full symbol discovery is handled by:
       ; - `INTERNAL_FUNCTION_INDEX.csv` (Non-governed, regenerable inventory)

     ; - If `GLOBAL_REGISTRY_MASTER.csv` is inaccessible or cannot be fully read, the AI MUST STOP.

4. **CONTENT-FINGERPRINT ENFORCEMENT:**
   ; - The Content-Fingerprint declared in this file (`GOVERNANCE_COMPENDIUM.txt :: SECTION GOV.S3.BLUEPRINT`) MUST be extracted and verified against the current Drive mirror before use.
   ; - Any mismatch between the declared fingerprint and the Drive mirror constitutes a hard stop.

5. **TOOLING LIMITATION HARD-STOP:**
   ; - If tooling limitations (including truncation, partial reads, or access restrictions) prevent a verifiable full read of this file, any required governance file, or any required registry section, the AI must stop and explicitly report the limitation.
   ; - The AI must not infer, assume, summarize, or fabricate missing content under any circumstances.

6. **CUMULATIVE INTEGRITY:** Never remove registry entries.
   Updates must maintain a 1:1 literal match with the source code and verified mirrors.

; ------------------------------------------------------------------
### GOV.S3.D — GLOBAL LOGIC ANCHORS
; ------------------------------------------------------------------

; - **DRY ARCHITECTURE:** No variable or function definitions should be hardcoded in text documents.
Refer to `GLOBAL_REGISTRY_MASTER.csv` for Policy-B governed surface area ownership and invariants.
For full symbol inventory, consult `INTERNAL_FUNCTION_INDEX.csv` (informational; non-governed).

; - **IPC STANDARD:** All communication between Controller and Worker uses WM_COPYDATA or custom message `0x5555`.

; - **STATE PERSISTENCE:** The Worker must remain a slave to `Settings.ini`; enforcement is handled by the Watchdog in `WorkerState.ahk`.

; - **GROUND TRUTH RULES (MANDATORY):** Logic invariants and non-negotiable behavior rules are defined in `GLOBAL_REGISTRY_MASTER.csv`
(Policy-B governed surface area). These rules must be consulted before audit, debugging, refactor, or feature change.

This file MUST NOT override Bootstrap v4.

; ------------------------------------------------------------------
1. MISSION STATEMENT & IDENTITY (MUST BE MAINTAINED)
; ------------------------------------------------------------------

Pipz_Project_V3 is a dual-process automation system composed of:

; - **Controller (GUI / Orchestration)**
; - **Worker (Execution / Overlay / Runtime Engine)**

The system is implemented in **AutoHotkey v2** and is governed by strict separation of:
; - Authority
; - Visibility
; - Verification
; - Runtime execution

**CRITICAL IDENTITY RULE**
Every governed file **MUST** declare its identity using:

; GEMINI MEM TAG
; MY FULL PATH IS "Pipz_Project_V3\<relative\path>"

Absence, ambiguity, or mismatch of this tag constitutes a **hard stop**.

; ------------------------------------------------------------------
2. BOOTSTRAP & GOVERNANCE DEFERENCE (AUTHORITATIVE)
; ------------------------------------------------------------------

This file **DOES NOT** define initialization behavior.
All initialization, indexing, verification, and authority establishment is governed by:

; - `GOVERNANCE_COMPENDIUM.txt :: SECTION GOV.S1.AI_INSTRUCTIONS`
; - `GOVERNANCE_COMPENDIUM.txt :: SECTION GOV.S2.BOOTSTRAP_V4`

**RULES**
; - Bootstrap v4 is mandatory.
; - Phase ordering is strict.
; - This Anchor MUST NOT introduce alternate search paths, shortcuts, or fallback logic.
; - Any conflict between this file and Bootstrap v4 MUST be resolved in favor of Bootstrap v4.

**SYSTEM HIERARCHY & AUTHORITY**
The hierarchy of authority for Pipz_Project_V3 is:

1. GOVERNANCE_COMPENDIUM.txt :: SECTION GOV.S1.AI_INSTRUCTIONS (Rules 0–16)
2. GOVERNANCE_COMPENDIUM.txt :: SECTION GOV.S2.BOOTSTRAP_V4 (Initialization)
3. GOVERNANCE_COMPENDIUM.txt :: SECTION GOV.S3.BLUEPRINT (Structural Truth)
4. GLOBAL_REGISTRY_MASTER.csv (Authoritative governed registry, Policy-B)
5. INTERNAL_FUNCTION_INDEX.csv (Informational, regenerable; non-governed)
6. GLOBAL_REGISTRY_MASTER.gsheet (Backup Vault ONLY; may be unreadable to tooling)
7. GOVERNANCE_COMPENDIUM.txt :: SECTION GOV.S4.ANCHOR_MASTER (Intent & Rationale)

**NEW CHAT INVOCATION (REFERENCE ONLY)**
For a fresh session cold-start, the required user invocation (including the machine-checkable token `BOOTSTRAP_V4_INIT`) is defined in:

; - `GOVERNANCE_COMPENDIUM.txt :: SECTION GOV.S1.AI_INSTRUCTIONS`

This Anchor does not redefine or override invocation enforcement.

; ------------------------------------------------------------------
3. VISIBILITY VS GOVERNANCE DISTINCTION (CLARIFIED)
; ------------------------------------------------------------------

The project contains **three classes of artifacts**:

### A. Governed & Readable
; - `.txt` mirrors
; - Governance documents
; - Registry spreadsheets

These require:
; - Full read access
; - Content-Fingerprint verification
; - Path identity validation

### B. Runtime-Only / Non-Readable (N/A Governance)
Examples:
; - `.ahk`
; - `.ini`
; - `.png`
; - `.key`

These:
; - MUST exist at declared paths
; - MAY be enumerated via Drive
; - MUST NOT be read or reasoned about directly
; - Are classified as **N/A** in `GOVERNANCE_COMPENDIUM.txt :: SECTION GOV.S7.INDEX_ID_LIST`

### C. Externalized Authority
; - `GLOBAL_REGISTRY_MASTER.gsheet`

This is a **non-negotiable source of truth** and must be fully readable.

; ------------------------------------------------------------------
4. STRUCTURAL & EXPECTED-SET AUTHORITY (REFERENCE ONLY)
; ------------------------------------------------------------------

The expected project structure **and the authoritative Expected Set used for Phase 5** are defined **exclusively** in:

; - `GOVERNANCE_COMPENDIUM.txt :: SECTION GOV.S3.BLUEPRINT`

This Anchor:
; - May reference structure for contextual understanding only
; - MUST NOT redefine structure
; - MUST NOT define, expand, or reduce the Phase 5 Expected Set
; - MUST NOT drift from the Blueprint

If structure or expected items change:
; - `GOVERNANCE_COMPENDIUM.txt :: SECTION GOV.S3.BLUEPRINT` is updated first
; - This file is synchronized second

; ------------------------------------------------------------------
5. FINGERPRINT & VERIFICATION BEHAVIOR (DEFERRED)
; ------------------------------------------------------------------

All fingerprint rules, cache-busting behavior, and Fingerprint Challenge Mode (FCM) handling are defined in:

; - `GOVERNANCE_COMPENDIUM.txt :: SECTION GOV.S1.AI_INSTRUCTIONS`

This Anchor:
; - Acknowledges fingerprint supremacy
; - Does not restate enforcement logic
; - Does not introduce alternative validation rules

; ------------------------------------------------------------------
6. SYSTEM INTENT (NON-TECHNICAL ANCHOR)
; ------------------------------------------------------------------

The purpose of Pipz_Project_V3 is to:

; - Maintain deterministic behavior
; - Prevent inference-based drift
; - Enforce literal verification
; - Preserve long-term system integrity across sessions

The AI is a **verifier and executor**, never an estimator.

; ------------------------------------------------------------------
7. SYNCHRONIZATION OBLIGATION (MANDATORY)
; ------------------------------------------------------------------

Any change that affects:
; - Structure
; - Governance
; - Authority
; - Initialization
; - Verification semantics

MUST be synchronized across:
; - GOVERNANCE_COMPENDIUM.txt :: SECTION GOV.S3.BLUEPRINT
; - GOVERNANCE_COMPENDIUM.txt :: SECTION GOV.S4.ANCHOR_MASTER
; - GOVERNANCE_COMPENDIUM.txt :: SECTION GOV.S1.AI_INSTRUCTIONS
; - GOVERNANCE_COMPENDIUM.txt :: SECTION GOV.S7.INDEX_ID_LIST (when applicable)
; - GLOBAL_REGISTRY_MASTER.gsheet
; - GLOBAL_REGISTRY_MASTER.csv

Partial updates are invalid.

; PHASE 5 — GOVERNANCE AUDIT CONTRACT
; ------------------------------------------------------------------

Phase 5 is the **final governance verification stage**.

Its purpose is to assert, with determinism and without inference, that the
**Observed Project State** exactly matches the **Expected Set** defined by
governance.

Phase 5 governs **visibility, accessibility, and structural correctness** only.
It does not authorize remediation, modification, refactor, or interpretation.

---

### AUTHORITATIVE DEFINITIONS

**Expected Set**
The complete and exclusive set of directories, files, and virtual governance
sections defined in:

- GOVERNANCE_COMPENDIUM.txt :: SECTION GOV.S3.BLUEPRINT

No other artifact may define, expand, or reduce the Expected Set.

**Observed Set**
The set of items discovered via deterministic enumeration of the project root,
using Bootstrap-aligned resolution rules and parent-child traversal only.

---

### EXECUTION AUTHORITY

Phase 5 execution is **mandatory** and **non-optional** when invoked.

Execution of Phase 5 MUST be performed **exclusively** via:

  PROTOCOL_RUNBOOK.txt :: Runbook §3  
  "PHASE 5 AUDIT EXECUTION RUNBOOK"

No procedural steps for Phase 5 exist in this compendium section.

Any Phase 5 audit not executed via the runbook is **invalid by definition**.

---

### PASS / FAIL SEMANTICS

Phase 5 is considered **FAILED** if **any** of the following occur:

- Any Expected Set item is missing from the Observed Set
- Any Observed item exists outside the Expected Set
- Any required governance artifact or virtual section cannot be fully read
- Deterministic verification cannot be achieved due to tooling limitations
- Any ambiguity exists in classification or reconciliation

Phase 5 is considered **PASSED** only when:

- The Observed Set exactly matches the Expected Set
- All required governance artifacts are readable
- No extraneous, missing, misplaced, or ungoverned items exist
- Execution completed without triggering a STOP condition

---

### REPORTING CONSTRAINTS

Phase 5 reporting is **read-only**.

The Phase 5 audit may produce:
- classification results
- discrepancy listings
- PASS / FAIL declaration

The audit MUST NOT:
- modify project files
- propose fixes
- infer causes
- perform remediation

Results MUST be declared **exclusively** via:

  PROTOCOL_RUNBOOK.txt :: Runbook §4  
  "PHASE 5 RESULT DECLARATION RUNBOOK"

---

### GOVERNANCE BINDING

A Phase 5 PASS declaration is authoritative only if:

- Bootstrap v4 (Phases 0–4) completed successfully
- This section was fully readable
- PROTOCOL_RUNBOOK.txt :: Runbook §3 was executed in full
- No STOP conditions were encountered

Any claimed Phase 5 result that violates these constraints is void.

GOVERNANCE LAYER LOCK — DECLARATION OF STABLE STATE
; ------------------------------------------------------------------

(CANONICAL, NON-AUTHORITATIVE)

This document records a **governance lifecycle state transition** for Pipz_Project_V3.

It does NOT define rules.
It does NOT grant authority.
It does NOT override any governance mechanism.

Its sole purpose is to provide a **durable, verifiable record** that the governance layer
has entered a **stable, locked phase**.

; ------------------------------------------------------------------
1. GOVERNANCE LOCK STATUS
; ------------------------------------------------------------------

Status: **LOCKED (OPERATIONAL)**

As of this declaration:

; - The governance architecture for Pipz_Project_V3 is considered **stable**
; - Core governance rules are finalized, including implicit file resolution and constraint consultation rules
; - Initialization, verification, and enforcement semantics are fixed

The authoritative governance sources remain:

; - `GOVERNANCE_COMPENDIUM.txt :: SECTION GOV.S1.AI_INSTRUCTIONS`
; - `GOVERNANCE_COMPENDIUM.txt :: SECTION GOV.S2.BOOTSTRAP_V4`
; - `GOVERNANCE_COMPENDIUM.txt :: SECTION GOV.S3.BLUEPRINT`
; - `GOVERNANCE_COMPENDIUM.txt :: SECTION GOV.S4.ANCHOR_MASTER`
; - `GOVERNANCE_COMPENDIUM.txt :: SECTION GOV.S7.INDEX_ID_LIST`

This file does not participate in governance enforcement.

; ------------------------------------------------------------------
2. SCOPE OF THE LOCK
; ------------------------------------------------------------------

The following are considered **locked**:

; - Bootstrap v4 phase structure and semantics
; - Content-Fingerprint enforcement rules
; - GEMINI MEM TAG identity requirements
; - Stop-on-conflict behavior
; - Verification precedence rules
; - Phase 5 invocation boundaries

The following remain **permitted** without reopening governance:

; - Adding new files or modules to the project
; - Updating `GOVERNANCE_COMPENDIUM.txt :: SECTION GOV.S3.BLUEPRINT` to reflect structural extensions
; - Updating `GOVERNANCE_COMPENDIUM.txt :: SECTION GOV.S7.INDEX_ID_LIST` to reflect new resolvable items
; - Updating mirrors and fingerprints as part of normal operation

No change may alter **governance behavior** without explicitly reopening the governance layer.

; ------------------------------------------------------------------
3. WHAT THIS FILE IS NOT
; ------------------------------------------------------------------

This document:

; - Is NOT consulted during Bootstrap execution
; - Is NOT required for Bootstrap success
; - Is NOT used to resolve conflicts
; - Is NOT used to validate fingerprints
; - Is NOT referenced during Phase 5 execution
; - Is NOT a substitute for any governance file

In all conflicts, this file has **zero authority**.

; ------------------------------------------------------------------
4. GOVERNANCE REOPENING RULE (STRICT)
; ------------------------------------------------------------------

Reopening the governance layer requires **explicit, intentional action**.

A governance reopening MUST:

1. Be explicitly declared by the user

2. Result in a versioned update to:

   ; - `GOVERNANCE_COMPENDIUM.txt :: SECTION GOV.S1.AI_INSTRUCTIONS`
   ; - AND / OR `GOVERNANCE_COMPENDIUM.txt :: SECTION GOV.S2.BOOTSTRAP_V4`

3. Be accompanied by an updated declaration in this file

Absent those conditions, governance is considered locked.

; ------------------------------------------------------------------
5. INTENDED AUDIENCE
; ------------------------------------------------------------------

This file exists for:

; - Long-term project integrity
; - Future session clarity
; - Human verification
; - Audit traceability

It exists to prevent ambiguity — not to introduce it.

AUTHORITY NOTICE (MANDATORY)
; ------------------------------------------------------------------

This file provides deterministic Google Drive folder and file IDs to accelerate
indexing, traversal, and bootstrap operations.

This file is NOT a source of truth for:

; - File contents
; - Folder structure
; - Ownership
; - Logic
; - Governance
; - Verification outcomes

All content authority, verification, and conflict resolution is governed by:

; - GOVERNANCE_COMPENDIUM.txt :: SECTION GOV.S1.AI_INSTRUCTIONS
; - GOVERNANCE_COMPENDIUM.txt :: SECTION GOV.S3.BLUEPRINT
; - GOVERNANCE_COMPENDIUM.txt :: SECTION GOV.S4.ANCHOR_MASTER

Content-Fingerprint verification and GEMINI MEM TAG path validation are mandatory
for all files, even when Drive IDs are available.

Non-authoritative canonical logs (e.g. learned constraints, working notes) may be indexed here for resolution but do not participate in authority precedence.

; ------------------------------------------------------------------
VERIFIED COLUMN SEMANTICS (STRICT)
; ------------------------------------------------------------------

MICRO-RULE — NON-RESOLVABLE CONTENT CLASSIFICATION (MANDATORY)

Runtime artifacts, binary assets, and opaque data files that are not
opened, read, or governed as authoritative content MUST use:

; - VERIFIED = N/A

This includes, but is not limited to:

; - .ahk runtime scripts
; - .ini configuration files
; - Binary assets (e.g. .png, .ico)
; - Secrets or opaque data (e.g. license.key)

VERIFIED = YES is RESERVED exclusively for items whose contents are
meaningfully resolvable, inspectable, and auditable as governance inputs.

Marking non-resolvable content as VERIFIED = YES is prohibited.

The VERIFIED column indicates whether the listed Drive ID has been:

; - Successfully resolved via Google Drive
; - Confirmed to exist and be accessible
; - Confirmed to correspond to the declared PATH and TYPE

VERIFIED does NOT indicate:

; - Content correctness
; - Content freshness
; - Fingerprint validity
; - Governance compliance

Allowed values:

; - YES  → ID resolved and matched to declared path/type
; - NO   → ID known but not yet revalidated
; - N/A  → Non-resolvable content (e.g. runtime-only, ephemeral, or excluded)

VERIFIED status MUST NOT override:

; - GEMINI MEM TAG path declarations
; - Content-Fingerprint checks
; - Blueprint-defined structure
; - AI_PROJECT_INSTRUCTIONS enforcement

; ------------------------------------------------------------------
ID USAGE & PRECEDENCE RULES (STRICT)
; ------------------------------------------------------------------

1. File and folder IDs listed here MAY be used to:

   ; - Locate items deterministically
   ; - Enumerate child contents of folders
   ; - Accelerate indexing when Drive search is ambiguous or truncated

2. File and folder IDs listed here MUST NOT:

   ; - Override declared paths in GEMINI MEM TAG headers
   ; - Override structure defined in GOVERNANCE_COMPENDIUM.txt :: SECTION GOV.S3.BLUEPRINT
   ; - Override verification rules defined in GOVERNANCE_COMPENDIUM.txt :: SECTION GOV.S1.AI_INSTRUCTIONS

3. In all conflicts:

   ; - Declared path wins over ID
   ; - Content-Fingerprint wins over VERIFIED
   ; - Blueprint structure wins over ID
   ; - Governance rules win over all

IDs and VERIFIED flags are acceleration signals only, never authority.

NON-AUTHORITATIVE NOTICE (MANDATORY)
; ------------------------------------------------------------------

This section records empirically discovered constraints and invalidated
approaches encountered during the development of Pipz_Project_V3.

Learned Constraints (PLC) exist to preserve institutional memory and
prevent regression across sessions, tools, and AI systems.

PLCs are SUPPORTING INFORMATION ONLY.

They do NOT:

; - Define governance rules
; - Override GOVERNANCE_COMPENDIUM.txt :: SECTION GOV.S1.AI_INSTRUCTIONS
; - Override GOVERNANCE_COMPENDIUM.txt :: SECTION GOV.S2.BOOTSTRAP_V4
; - Override GOVERNANCE_COMPENDIUM.txt :: SECTION GOV.S3.BLUEPRINT
; - Override PROTOCOL_RUNBOOK.txt
; - Override GLOBAL_REGISTRY_MASTER.csv or .gsheet
; - Override registry ownership, structure, or invariants

If any PLC conflicts with an authoritative source:

; - The authoritative source ALWAYS wins
; - The conflict MUST be surfaced
; - The PLC MUST NOT be used for enforcement or justification

This section is institutional memory only.

; ------------------------------------------------------------------
CANONICAL SOURCE
; ------------------------------------------------------------------

The canonical, append-only store for all Project Learned Constraints is:

Pipz_Project_V3\Governance\PROJECT_LEARNED_CONSTRAINTS.txt

This compendium section is a synchronized view only.

If a discrepancy exists between this section and the canonical PLC file:

; - The canonical PLC file is authoritative
; - This section MUST be updated or truncated to match

; ------------------------------------------------------------------
SCOPE MODEL (INFORMATIONAL)
; ------------------------------------------------------------------

Each PLC entry is tagged with EXACTLY ONE scope from the canonical scope
taxonomy defined in the canonical PLC file.

Scopes classify the domain a constraint applies to and MUST NOT be
repurposed, overloaded, or combined.

; ------------------------------------------------------------------
SNAPSHOT MODE (OPTIONAL)
; ------------------------------------------------------------------

To preserve single-artifact usability, this section MAY include a
snapshot of the most recent PLC entries.

Snapshot rules:

; - Snapshot entries MUST be copied mechanically from the canonical PLC file
; - Snapshot entries MUST NOT be edited, summarized, or reinterpreted
; - Snapshot entries MAY be truncated to the most recent N entries
; - A "Last Synced (UTC)" line MUST be present if snapshot mode is used

Snapshot presence does NOT grant authority.

; ------------------------------------------------------------------
PLC EMISSION (SUMMARY ONLY)
; ------------------------------------------------------------------

New PLC entries MUST:

; - Be explicitly confirmed before recording
; - Follow the strict PLC entry format
; - Be appended only to the canonical PLC file
; - Update the scope index atomically

The authoritative emission procedure is defined in:

PROTOCOL_RUNBOOK.txt — PLC Externalization & Emission Runbook

MANDATED HEADER STYLES (ABSOLUTE)
; ------------------------------------------------------------------

Headers are defined by HEADER CLASS.
Each file type MUST use the header class it is bound to.
All header content is literal unless explicitly parameterized.

<EXT> MUST match the actual file extension.
All other fields MUST NOT be altered.

; ------------------------------------------------------------------
HEADER CLASS: SEMICOLON_COMMENT_HEADER
; ------------------------------------------------------------------

APPLIES TO FILE TYPES:
- .txt
- .md

SPECIAL CASE:
- .ahk MUST use SEMICOLON_COMMENT_HEADER for its 14-line reserved header region,
  and MUST additionally comply with the AHK-specific signpost rules defined below.
  The AHK-specific rules do not redefine the header; they extend requirements
  immediately after the reserved header region.

FILE TYPE = .json
MANDATED HEADER STYLE = NONE (JSON FILES MUST REMAIN PURE)

RATIONALE:
- JSON does NOT support comments.
- package.json, tsconfig.json, and similar files are parsed by strict toolchains
  (npm, Node, TypeScript, VS Code extension host).
- ANY header or comment inside a .json file WILL break tooling.

GOVERNANCE REQUIREMENT (MANDATORY):

ALL GOVERNED .json FILES MUST USE A SIDECAR GOVERNANCE FILE.

SIDECAR FILE NAMING RULE:
- <original_filename>.governance.txt

EXAMPLES:
- package.json               → package.json.governance.txt
- tsconfig.json              → tsconfig.json.governance.txt
- settings.schema.json       → settings.schema.json.governance.txt

SIDECAR FILE REQUIREMENTS:
- MUST contain a full MAINTEMPLATE header (standard .txt format)
- MUST include GEMINI MEM TAG with FULL PATH pointing to the SIDECAR FILE
- MUST reference the governed JSON file explicitly in content
- MUST receive Content-Fingerprint updates on save
- MUST be listed in GOVERNANCE_COMPENDIUM.txt :: SECTION GOV.S7.INDEX_ID_LIST as the authoritative governance artifact

THE .json FILE ITSELF:
- MUST remain valid, comment-free JSON
- MUST NOT contain governance metadata
- IS CONSIDERED A RUNTIME / TOOL-CONSTRAINED ARTIFACT

FILE TYPE = .ahk
MANDATED HEADER STYLE = SEMICOLON_COMMENT_HEADER (INHERITED)

ADDITIONAL AHK-SPECIFIC REQUIREMENTS (MANDATORY):

; ------------------------------------------------------------------
; SIGNPOST GOVERNANCE (AHK ONLY)
; ------------------------------------------------------------------
; DIRECTIVES (AI-ONLY | DO NOT COPY INTO FILE SIGNPOSTS):
; - The signpost block must be placed at the TOP of the file’s content area
;   (immediately after the 14-line reserved header region).
; - The USER does NOT fill this out. The AI fills this out when a new file/module
;   is created or when a file’s governance surface changes.
; - The signpost is COMMENT-ONLY. It must never require touching or reformatting
;   executable code to remain valid.
; - The signpost must be factual and implementation-linked (names, callbacks, IDs).
; - Use "N/A" explicitly if a section does not apply (never delete headings).
; - Do not include speculative future behavior; document what exists now.
; - Any signpost output that includes DIRECTIVES is invalid and must be corrected.
;
; POLICY-B DIRECTIVES (AI-ONLY):
; - GLOBAL_REGISTRY_MASTER.csv is the authoritative governed registry (Policy-B).
; - INTERNAL_FUNCTION_INDEX.csv is NON-GOVERNED and exists only for full symbol discovery.
; - The AI MUST consult GLOBAL_REGISTRY_MASTER.csv before changing:
;     * entrypoints, timers, OnMessage/IPC handlers, IPC contracts, lifecycle controls,
;       settings IO, or defaults interface behavior.
; - The AI MUST NOT require a governed registry update for internal helper changes.
; - Missing or drifting entries in INTERNAL_FUNCTION_INDEX.csv are never a hard-stop.
; - If you add/remove a timer, OnMessage, IPC contract, lifecycle control, or
;   settings/defaults interface, you MUST update GLOBAL_REGISTRY_MASTER.csv.

; ------------------------------------------------------------------
; GLOBAL GOVERNANCE NOTE (APPLIES TO ALL FILE TYPES)
; ------------------------------------------------------------------

; If a file format is controlled by an external compiler, interpreter,
; or toolchain and does not safely support comments or headers,
; governance metadata MUST NOT be embedded directly.

; In such cases, governance MUST be implemented via:
; - a sidecar .governance.txt file, OR
