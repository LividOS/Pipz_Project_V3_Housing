ENTRY ID: PLC-0001
DATE (UTC): 2026-01-21
SCOPE: Governance
STATUS: CONFIRMED
TITLE: Google Drive preview truncates structured governance files unless formatting is normalized

CONTEXT:
AI governance and bootstrap files stored in Google Drive were intermittently unreadable or partially truncated when accessed via preview or connector-based reads.

DISCOVERY:
Google Drive preview and extraction systems may truncate or fail to fully render governance documents that contain dense structural formatting such as repeated ASCII delimiter blocks (e.g. "=====", "---"), mixed delimiter styles, or Markdown-like constructs, even when file size is small.

INVALIDATED APPROACH:
Storing governance files with mixed or stacked delimiters, Markdown horizontal rules, or long single-character separator blocks.

VALIDATED CONSTRAINT:
Governance files must use a single, non-Markdown, commented delimiter style and avoid dense or mixed ASCII separator patterns to ensure full Drive preview and connector readability.

EVIDENCE:
Multiple governance files became fully readable in Drive only after delimiter normalization and removal of Markdown constructs; prior versions consistently truncated.

NOTES:

ENTRY ID: PLC-0002
DATE (UTC): 2026-01-21
SCOPE: CrossCutting
STATUS: CONFIRMED
TITLE: Canonical commented delimiter required for governance file stability

CONTEXT:
Multiple governance and audit files required normalization to ensure consistent readability and prevent Drive-based truncation.

DISCOVERY:
A single commented delimiter line is reliably treated as plain text by Google Drive preview and extraction systems, while legacy or Markdown-style delimiters are not.

INVALIDATED APPROACH:
Use of "=====", "---", mixed delimiter styles, or Markdown section separators in governance documents.

VALIDATED CONSTRAINT:
All governance and audit files must standardize on the canonical delimiter:
"; ------------------------------------------------------------------"

EVIDENCE:
After standardizing on this delimiter, all governance files rendered fully in Drive preview and were readable end-to-end.

DATE (UTC): 2026-01-21
SCOPE: CrossCutting
STATUS: CONFIRMED
TITLE: UTF-16 mis-decoding can cause intermittent GEMINI path extraction failures in mirroring scripts

CONTEXT:
MirrorAhkToTxt.py intermittently logged "missing project path in GEMINI MEM TAG; skipping mirror" even when the GEMINI MEM TAG line was present.

DISCOVERY:
If runtime text is decoded incorrectly (e.g., UTF-8 bytes mis-decoded as UTF-16), header scanning and regex extraction may fail inconsistently across saves, sometimes triggered by small whitespace changes.

INVALIDATED APPROACH:
Blindly attempting UTF-16 decoding first for all buffer text without BOM/NUL detection.

VALIDATED CONSTRAINT:
Text decoding in mirroring/fingerprinting utilities must be BOM/NUL-aware: only prefer UTF-16 when strongly indicated (BOM or NUL bytes); otherwise prefer UTF-8.

EVIDENCE:
Header/path extraction failures occurred inconsistently until BOM/NUL-aware decoding was used, after which mirroring behaved deterministically across whitespace-only edits.

ENTRY ID: PLC-0004
DATE (UTC): 2026-01-21
SCOPE: CrossCutting
STATUS: CONFIRMED
TITLE: AI SOT header must exist only in .txt mirrors, never in runtime .ahk/.ini files

CONTEXT:
MirrorAhkToTxt.py showed inconsistent behavior and false "missing project path" errors during fingerprint/mirror operations.

DISCOVERY:
Placing the AI SOT mirror header inside a runtime file (.ahk/.ini) can interfere with header scanning assumptions and lead to incorrect mirroring/fingerprinting behavior.

INVALIDATED APPROACH:
Including the AI SOT header block inside runtime files.

VALIDATED CONSTRAINT:
Runtime files (.ahk/.ini) must contain only the GEMINI MEM TAG + MAINTEMPLATE header (with Content-Fingerprint). The AI SOT header is reserved exclusively for .txt mirror outputs.

EVIDENCE:
Removing the AI SOT header from runtime files restored deterministic fingerprinting and mirroring behavior.

DATE (UTC): 2026-01-21
SCOPE: CrossCutting
STATUS: CONFIRMED
TITLE: LLM whitespace cleanup can alter Python indentation and break MirrorAhkToTxt.py

CONTEXT:
MirrorAhkToTxt.py was passed through an external AI tool for "removing empty/unnecessary lines" to reduce visual bloat.

DISCOVERY:
LLM formatting passes can modify indentation or line structure even when instructed to only remove blank lines. In Python, indentation is semantic; accidental indentation changes can introduce syntax errors or change block structure.

INVALIDATED APPROACH:
Using an LLM to mass-remove blank lines or "normalize whitespace" in Python scripts without a deterministic verification step.

VALIDATED CONSTRAINT:
Whitespace cleanup for Python scripts must be mechanical and indentation-preserving (e.g., collapsing consecutive blank lines only) or must be followed by a strict syntax/indentation verification step before deployment.

EVIDENCE:
Gemini-cleaned MirrorAhkToTxt.py introduced an indentation change that required correction before the script could be treated as safe.

This is a tooling safety constraint; it does not change project governance semantics.

ENTRY ID: PLC-0006
DATE (UTC): 2026-01-25
SCOPE: Infrastructure
STATUS: CONFIRMED
TITLE: Google Drive .gsheet internal data is inaccessible to external connectors

CONTEXT:
Attempted use of Google Sheets as a live project registry for logic and state.

DISCOVERY:
The Google Drive API/connector exposes .gsheet files as metadata objects only; the tabular content (cells/tabs) is not streamable as raw text to the IDE or Gemini Code Assist.

INVALIDATED APPROACH:
Relying on .gsheet files for active project governance or state registries.

VALIDATED CONSTRAINT:
All project registries must exist as flat .csv files in the root registry directory to ensure visibility.

EVIDENCE:
Phase 2 Bootstrap failure on 2026-01-25; Agent reported file existence but "Zero content/Logic Blind" state.

RELATED FILES:

NOTES:
The .gsheet remains the non-active "Backup Vault".

ENTRY ID: PLC-0007
DATE (UTC): 2026-01-25
SCOPE: Tooling
STATUS: CONFIRMED
TITLE: Gemini Code Assist context window cannot parse multi-tab spreadsheet logic

CONTEXT:
Bootstrapping a project with complex registry dependencies involving multiple logic sheets.

DISCOVERY:
Current LLM tooling lacks the native ability to programmatically "switch tabs" or interpret spreadsheet-specific binary/XML formatting without high risk of hallucination.

INVALIDATED APPROACH:
Prompting the AI to "read Tab 2 of the registry sheet."

VALIDATED CONSTRAINT:
Governance data must be presented in flat, delimiter-heavy formats (CSV/TXT) to ensure high-fidelity LLM ingestion.

EVIDENCE:
Successful ingestion and audit only after transition to individual flat CSV files.

ENTRY ID: PLC-0008
DATE (UTC): 2026-01-25
SCOPE: Tooling
STATUS: CONFIRMED
TITLE: Gemini Code Assist Loop Detection Limit (Sequential Call Ceiling)

CONTEXT:
Sequential audit of 14+ files in a single turn using the code execution stream.

DISCOVERY:
The IDE execution stream triggers a 'loop_detected' error if sequential tool calls (read_file) exceed internal safety thresholds (~10-15 calls).

INVALIDATED APPROACH:
Running "Single-Sweep" audits or scans on more than 10 files in a single turn.

VALIDATED CONSTRAINT:
Automated processes must be segmented to reset the call counter every 5 operations.

EVIDENCE:
Error: "Unknown error from LLM stream: {'type':'loop_detected'}" encountered 2026-01-25.

RELATED FILES:
N/A

NOTES:
This is a technical safety ceiling of the Gemini Code Assist implementation.

ENTRY ID: PLC-0009
DATE (UTC): 2026-01-25
SCOPE: Audits
STATUS: CONFIRMED
TITLE: Mandatory Atomic Batching for Governance Verification

CONTEXT:
Performing Phase 5 Structural and Governance audits across a large codebase.

DISCOVERY:
Large-batch audits increase the risk of LLM "attention drift," leading to overlooked header errors or session timeouts.

INVALIDATED APPROACH:
Conducting full-project governance scans in a single prompt.

VALIDATED CONSTRAINT:
All governance audits must be executed in "Atomic Batches" of exactly 5 files to ensure 1:1 literal verification.

EVIDENCE:
PLC-0008 technical limitation; verification of 5-file batches results in 100% accuracy.
